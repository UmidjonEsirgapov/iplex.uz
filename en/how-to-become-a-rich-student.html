                Today's most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>How to properly distribute income and reduce expenses?</strong><br/><strong>Always stick to a budget and constantly save, even if it is 10,000 soums per month.</strong><br/><strong>For example, "100 per month Setting specific goals, such as "saving 000 soums", "collecting 2,000,000 soums in 6 months to buy a new laptop" increases motivation.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>If there is one more week left in the scholarship, but there is no money left in your pocket, then you have a financial planning problem. How to properly distribute income and reduce expenses? How can you have enough money not only for noodles and perashki, but also for sushi?</p> <h2>List the sources of money</h2> <p>Identify the sources of income: scholarship, help from your parents or salary. Consider only stable and regular income. It's easy to feel rich when counting money, but don't forget the real situation.</p> <h2>Allocate the budget correctly</h2> <p>Split your income in the following ratio (or close to it):</p> <ul> <li>50% - mandatory expenses (food, rent, clothing)</li> <li>30% - unexpected expenses and incentive expenses (medicine, entertainment, travel, gift)</li> <li>20% is savings.</li> </ul> <p>Always stick to a budget and save regularly, even if it is 10,000 soums per month. Follow the adage that a little is a lake.</p> <h2>Monetize your skills</h2> <p>Look for extra sources of income outside of school. For example, put your skills to work, such as translating, tutoring, content writing or graphic design. At least you can work as a waitress.</p> <p>You can find clients by opening a profile on freelancer platforms (for example, Fiverr or Upwork). Nowadays, online services are in great demand.</p> <h2>Take advantage of discounts and benefits</h2> <p>For example, if you issue an international student card <em>ISIC</em>, you can get discounts on a number of products and services not only in Uzbekistan, but all over the world. With this card, you can travel cheaper, buy educational courses and even get medical treatment.</p> <p>It is better to buy clothes during the season of discounts, and we recommend using the <em>ATTO</em> student transport card to walk around the city. You can get this card at <em>UzPost</em> branches or metro cash desks by presenting a copy of your passport and student ID card.</p> <h2>Get cashback and a bonus card</h2> <p>For example, when you make purchases through bank partners (taxi and food delivery services) using the <em>Salom</em> card, you will receive 5% cashback. In addition, you can earn 12% annual income on your card balance. If you keep 1 million soums on your card, 10,000 soums will be added per month and 120,000 soums per year. It's a nice little income for a student :)</p> <h2>Stay away from loans and mortgages</h2> <p>Avoid taking out loans or loans that exceed your means. Loans seem to solve the problem in the short term, but the interest rate of the loan can lead you to more financial difficulties.</p> <p>Also, do not make a habit of buying goods by paying in installments. Saving up for the things you need will cost you a lot less, and it will build the discipline to save.</p> <h2>Write down your financial goals</h2> <p>List your big and small money-related plans. For example, setting specific goals such as "to save 100,000 soums per month" or "to collect 2,000,000 soums in 6 months to buy a new laptop" will increase motivation. The amount of the presidential scholarship amounts to 2,191,541 soums, and famous state scholarships (for example, Beruni, Navoi or Ulugbek) amount to 1,461,028 soums. For this money, you can order not only pizza, but also sushi. But it's not enough to just say "I'll close in five" - ​​there must be knowledge. 🙂</p> <h2>Get a tax credit for the contract</h2> <p>For the contract payment, the state will refund the income tax. For this, it is enough to submit an application through <em>Soliq Mobile</em> or <em>Government Services</em> application. Learn more about how to apply.</p> <h2>Buy food wisely</h2> <p>Don't go shopping on an empty stomach! Starvation leads to overspending. For food, go to the big supermarkets or the market and plan and buy in advance what you need for the week. This not only saves money, but also helps in efficient allocation of time. Don't forget that eating at home is twice as cheap as eating out!</p> <h2>Split the costs with your friends</h2> <p>If you live in a student dormitory or rent, you can save money by sharing the costs of food and utilities with your friends. Also, commuting long distances together cuts down on transportation costs.</p> <h2>Use free online educational resources</h2> <p>Instead of spending extra money on courses, look for free online resources. For example, there are many free tutorials on <em>Coursera</em>, <em>Khan Academy</em>, or <em>YouTube</em>.</p> <p>This will not only help you save money, but also improve your skills and help you find a high-paying job in the future.</p> <p><strong>These are our little tips for now. Students, how do you budget? </strong>If you have already finished your studies, remember how you survived those times and share our post with your fellow students. Maybe you also know the "perfect pasta or buckwheat recipe"? 😄</p> <p><em>P.S: In writing the article, a post on the NECHPUL telegram channel was used.</em> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kambagal-oilalarning-alochi-talaba-qizlariga-maxsus-stipendiya-tolanadi-batafsil-tartibi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
