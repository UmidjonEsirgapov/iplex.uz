For this purpose, it is planned to establish a system of training of teachers and pedagogues of kindergartens and schools every 5 years at the National Research Institute named after Abdulla Avloni.</p> <p>11 pedagogic colleges in the regions were transferred to the training centers, and the task of attracting trainers from abroad was also set. It was also said that kindergartens and schools, technical schools, and "Barkamol Avlod" school will be established on the basis of pedagogical colleges that are working at low capacity. As a result of this system, students' mastery increased from 53% to 59%. From the new academic year, this system will be used in 1,000 more schools, and 182 specialized and 500 experimental schools will be added to them.</p> <h3>New methods and equipment</h3> <p>270 schools will be equipped with interactive whiteboards, 365 will be equipped with computer classrooms.
