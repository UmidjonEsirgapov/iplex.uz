                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>439 thousand 337 applicants (49.4%) did not even score 56.7 points, the minimum threshold for the passing score.</strong><br/><strong>Last year 51.2% percent, more precisely 550 thousand applicants scored 56.7 points 5 regions that improved their results the most compared to last year: Tashkent city - 4.4% Bukhara - 4.4% Tashkent region - 3.5% Namangan - 3.3% Fergana - 2.4% has worsened.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>According to open data on the mandat.uzbmb.uz website, 888 thousand 472 applicants took the test this year.</p> <p>439 thousand 337 applicants (49.4%) failed to score 56.7 points, which is the minimum passing score. So, they left the fight before the mandate. Because those who scored less than 56.7 points cannot enter even if there is a place in the quota.</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/5/1100__svZkYKkhwj_1LtXZoNnaBuWyzG61-s90.png"/></p> <p>The number of applicants who scored more than 56.7 is 449 thousand. (50.6%).</p> <p>Compared to last year, our situation has slightly improved. Last year, 51.2% percent, more precisely, 550,000 applicants could not score even 56.7 points, this year this indicator fell to 49.4%.</p> <p>In 2023, the worst result was recorded in Syrdaro region (54.9%), and the best result was recorded in Tashkent city (40.8%), just like last year (see the table above).</p> <p>8 more than 50 percent of applicants in the region scored below 56.7 points. Last year there were 9 regions, this year Namangan region improved the result and dropped below 50%.</p> <p>🟢 5 regions that improved the result the most compared to last year:</p> <ul> <li>Tashkent city - 4.4%</li> <li>Bukhara - 4.4%</li> <li>Tashkent region - 3.5%</li> <li>Namangan - 3.3%</li> <li>Fergana - 2.4%</li> </ul> <p>🔴 In Syrdarya and Andijan regions, the result has worsened compared to last year.</p> <p>56.7 points means 30% of the highest possible score of 189 points. That is, if the applicant has at least 30% knowledge, he can collect this indicator. And 30% of knowledge is not even 2 grades if we compare it with the rating system! It might be correct to say 1 grade. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/navoiy-medinstitut-ochilishi-mumkin" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
