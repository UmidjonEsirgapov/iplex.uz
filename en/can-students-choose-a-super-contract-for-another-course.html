                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Legal blogger Khushnudbek Khudoyerdiyev clarified this issue and noted that the procedure for this year has not yet been approved. If he enrolled in one of the 5 courses, he was allowed to study in the super-contract only in the course of his FIRST choice, as an exception.</strong><br/><strong>This exception does not apply to courses 2, 3 or 4.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Among the applicants, instead of the course he enrolled in, he is in a <strong>super-contract in another course There are many questions about whether there is an opportunity to study. For example, if an applicant does not have enough marks for the first or second course, but has entered the third course, can he study in the first or second course under a super-contract?</strong></p> <p><strong>Legal blogger Khushnudbek Khudoyerdiyev</strong> clarified this issue and noted that the procedure for this year has not yet been approved.</p> <p>"Last year, if the applicant was not able to enter the <strong>FIRST course</strong> of his choice, but enrolled in one of the 2, 3, 4, or 5 courses, he was allowed to study in the super-contract only in the <strong>FIRST course of his choice</strong> as an exception. This exception does not apply to routes 2, 3 or 4. That is, if the applicant entered the 3rd course, he could not study in the super-contract in the 2nd course, only the FIRST course was allowed," he says in his post. If the applicant was not able to enter all five courses, he is allowed to choose to study in the super-contract in any course. If he wants, he chooses the first, if he wants, he chooses the third or the fifth.</p> <p><strong>After the approval of this year's order</strong>, it is expected that an additional message will be issued in this regard. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kimyo-fizika-tarix-va-boshqa-fanlardan-milliy-sertifikat-topshirish-uchun-royxatdan-oting" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: prepared based on the information of the oliygoh.uz website
