                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>What determines the minimum passing score?</strong><br/><strong>The State Admission Commission approved the minimum passing scores for the state higher education institutions for the 2024-2025 academic year.</strong><br/><strong>Even if the applicant is within the quota, if the minimum score and if he does not record a high result, he is not recommended to the student.</strong><br/><hr/> <h3>What is the minimum passing score?</h3> <p>Every year, a <strong>minimum passing score</strong> is set in the tests. The State Admissions Commission approved the minimum passing scores for the state higher education institutions for the 2024-2025 academic year. According to it:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The minimum passing score for the state grant</strong> is 68.0 points (36% of the maximum 189.0 points);</li> <li><strong>The minimum passing score for the payment-contract</strong> is 56.7 points (30% of the maximum 189.0 points).</li> </ul> <p>Minimum passing score determines the minimum score that the applicant must collect for admission. Even if the applicant meets the specified quota, if he does not record the minimum score or higher, he will not be recommended for studentship.</p> <h3>What does this mean?</h3> <p>For example, a total of 24 quotas have been allocated to the "International Journalism" course, and even if the applicant is in the contract with a score of less than 56.7 points, he will not be accepted as a student. Or even if the applicant is in the grant quota with a score below 68 points, he will study under a contract rather than a grant. Because he recorded a result lower than the specified minimum score. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ozbekistonda-abituriyentlar-nechta" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p>
