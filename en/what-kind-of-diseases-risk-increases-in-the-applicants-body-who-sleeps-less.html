                Today's most relevant news in education is:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Healthy sleep is very important for the body.</strong><br/><strong>In addition, it is important to get enough sleep and make the deep sleep phase as long as possible.</strong><br/><strong>Insufficient sleep does not produce enough cytokines to effectively fight disease, and as a result, a person becomes sicker. will be.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Healthy sleep is very important for the body. Regardless of what happens during the day, it is important to get enough sleep at night. We bring to your attention 8 main dangers caused by constant lack of sleep.</p> <p><img src="https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ipnilia.jpg"/></p> <p>The body needs 8-9 hours of sleep to rest. In addition, it is important to get enough sleep and make the deep sleep phase last as long as possible. Not only does lack of sleep lead to poor mood and decreased performance - many studies confirm - regular lack of sleep has a negative effect on health and even life expectancy. Driving, exercising, and other activities that require good reflexes are impaired without enough sleep.</p> <h2>Memory becomes worse</h2> <p>Do you stay up all night to better prepare for an exam or an important speech? Maybe it could be worse. Lack of sleep affects the ability to remember new information, as well as to retrieve previously stored information from memory in a timely manner.</p> <h2>Weakened immunity</h2> <p>During sleep, the body not only rests, but also recovers. A two-year study confirmed that sleep actually speeds recovery from viral respiratory illnesses, such as the flu. During sleep, the immune system produces protective substances such as cytokines that fight bacteria and viruses. Lack of sleep does not produce enough cytokines to effectively fight disease, and the person becomes sicker as a result.</p> <h2>Increased risk of heart disease</h2> <p>Good sleep helps control blood sugar levels as well as blood pressure. The last factor is especially important for the health of the cardiovascular system. Many modern studies confirm a direct connection between lack of sleep and an increased risk of stroke and heart attack.</p> <h2>Increased risk of depression</h2> <p>A 2017 study involving 10,000 people showed that people who suffer from insomnia have a five times higher risk of developing depression. At the same time, insomnia is one of the first symptoms of this disease.</p> <h2>Weight gain</h2> <p>The less sleep, the lower the level of leptin, which regulates metabolism, and the higher the level of ghrelin, the so-called hunger hormone. In addition, lack of sleep increases the likelihood of choosing unhealthy foods to cope with stress.</p> <h2>Increased risk of diabetes</h2> <p>Good sleep helps the body process glucose. As a result of insufficient sleep, cells process glucose more slowly and the risk of diabetes increases significantly. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oqishdan-stress-olmaslik-uchun-qanday-tarzda-organish-kerak" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources.
