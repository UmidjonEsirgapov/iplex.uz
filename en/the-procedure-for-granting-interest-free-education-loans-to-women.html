For example, if an educational loan of 7 million soums is taken, after graduation, 83 thousand soums will be paid monthly for 7 years after 6 months. It is wrong to say that it will be given to those who entered the "Women's register" and needy families. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oqishni-kochirish-uchun-ariza-qabuli-15-iyuldan-boshlanadi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.</p>
