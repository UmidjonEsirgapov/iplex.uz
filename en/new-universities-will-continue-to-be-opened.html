                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>— In 2017, there were 77 higher education institutions in our republic, and among them there were almost no non-governmental HEIs. we need to digitize the processes.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>In Uzbekistan, the rate of coverage of higher education is increasing. The coverage, which was less than 9% during the past years, increased to 38% in just 6 years.</h4> <p>It is good that the coverage has increased, but how does the increase in it affect the issue of quality, what about our labor market, does it meet today's coverage requirements, is it ready? Deputy Minister of Education, Science and Innovation Komiljon Karimov was asked similar questions.<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5fFGyoqVGA?controls=1&amp;rel=0&amp;disablekb=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;html5=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;autopl ay=0&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;playsinline=1&amp;start=0&amp;fs=1&amp;nocookie=false&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fkun.uz&amp;widgetid=1"></iframe></p> <p>— <strong>If we pay attention to the increasing coverage in higher education in the following years. In 2015, it was 9 percent, but now it is between 35-40 percent. In some foreign countries, this indicator is around 80-90 percent, and we also have plans. In general, what should be the coverage of higher education in the conditions of Uzbekistan?</strong></p> <p>- Reforms are being implemented in higher education, like all other sectors, on the basis of specific programs. The concept of the development of the higher education system until 2030 was adopted. It is in this way that the development of the system is defined and specific goals are set.</p> <p>Higher education is not only an opportunity in the labor market. All over the world, higher education acts as a "social elevator". Most of the low-income population will be those who have not received higher education, that is, higher education opens up opportunities in every way. Half of our population is made up of young people, so the issue of education is important. Currently, there are 209 higher education institutions, and more than one million students study in them. Previously, there were only 250,000 students.</p> <p><strong>- The coverage is increasing due to the opening of branches of foreign HEIs, the opening of private and new state higher education institutions. Will it continue in this way?</strong></p> <p>— In 2017, there were 77 higher education institutions in our republic, and among them there were almost no non-state HEIs. Out of 209 HEIs, 114 are state higher education institutions, 65 are non-state, and the remaining 30 are branches of foreign HEIs. The largest increase in this is attributed to non-state higher education institutions. Its purpose is to develop competition. The involvement of the private sectors is the reason for the introduction of new approaches.</p> <p>Our president has set the task of establishing at least one non-state HEI in each region, and the process continues rapidly. New institutions will be opened this year as well.</p> <p>— <strong>While the coverage is increasing, the question of finding a place for the graduates in the labor market remains relevant. What to do about it? It seems that higher education institutions should not be limited only to education...</strong></p> <p>— About 250,000 students will graduate this year. The question arises whether there is a decent job for them in the labor market. But it is wrong that they are all employed by the state. We need to give some self-employment skills. And these processes have begun. Entrepreneurship skills are being taught in many higher education institutions. There is a requirement to establish career centers in many HEIs. These centers prepare students for the labor market. Formation of practical skills is envisaged. With the help of these centers, young people will be relieved.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/_iFlNxl4AdDv4zivAORMeu1yx22p3Jct.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>- As the number of students increases, the problem of dormitories is clearly felt. Is the issue of providing students with dormitories lagging behind the coverage?</strong></p> <p>— This issue is not only with the dormitories, but in the educational infrastructure as a whole. Today, the coverage of accommodation for students has exceeded 40 percent, that is, within the scope of students who need dormitories. Currently, new TTJs are being built, provided by the state or on the basis of private partnerships. There are clear plans for this and the process will continue. But it will be difficult to say that the state will create dormitories for all students. Compensation is also being paid to students living in rented accommodation.</p> <p>— <strong>In 2022, it was planned to build 47 student residences. To what extent has it been implemented? Can the problems observed last year also occur this year? But for some reasons, 28 student residences were put into use, more than 20,000 beds were created. However, we need to digitize the process to avoid problems. That is, creating a list of students who need to be provided with a dormitory and working on it. There will be an electronic queue system and it will be open.</strong></p> <p><strong>- At what stage is the higher education system in terms of digitalization today? What news can we expect in this regard?</strong></p> <p>— Digitization is a priority for us. A rating will be conducted among government agencies regarding digitization. According to the results of the third quarter of 2022, the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education took the second place among the ministries. Efforts are being made to digitize all educational processes. I think the HEMIS system, which is an electronic system of higher education management, is our biggest achievement. Our electronic platforms are integrated with the platforms of other government agencies. Let's say it is integrated with the platform of the unified public services, with the tax system, with the platforms of the public education system. In general, we have a lot of work to do in this regard, we still need to digitize many processes. The Ministry has a separate e-learning center and we have enough resources.</p> <p>— <strong>Let's talk about financial independence. In 2022 alone, 35 OTMs were granted financial independence. What has the past year shown in this regard? Are problems and shortcomings revealed?</strong></p> <p>— This is also one of the priority tasks: to give management, academic and financial independence to OTM. By the decision of the President, 35 OTMs were granted independence, and during the year their number reached 41. Organizational work was carried out within a year. Because it is not true to say that OTM, which has been in a centralized system for a long time, has changed in just one year. One of the important steps was the creation of monitoring councils in all HEIs, and they are already working. Based on the needs of the Higher Education Institution, the authority to make changes to its structure was given. One of the more important competences is the creation of strategic plans of HEIs. In addition, there are powers in financial matters. The issue of quotas is also being resolved independently. It is planned to give such powers to other educational institutions step by step.</p> <p>— <strong>Previously, it was said that there were many cases of corruption in admissions for master's and doctoral degrees. To what extent did the changes in reception affect it?</strong></p> <p>- It caused some disputes and objections. But here too we tried to get rid of the human factor. A foreign language certificate and an undergraduate GPA are required. No other documents are required, and there will be no exam. This is also a foreign experience. As a relief, admission to the master's degree was introduced twice, that is, in August and in the winter months. In general, corruption is disappearing in the admission process and it is possible to admit educated students who know a foreign language. What is being done in this regard?</p> <p>- We must recognize the achievements in this regard. Last year, in 2022, eight of our higher educational institutions entered the Asia's top 1000 ranking. This is the first time in our history. In addition, they improved their position in the world ranking. Another 28 HEIs were able to enter the rating. Of course, ratings have their own normative criteria. The most important thing is the scientific potential. Employment of graduates also plays an important role in this. The main goal is not to get into the rating, but to raise the scientific potential of the higher educational institution through those ratings, to raise the quality of education to a higher level.</p> <p><strong>You can watch the interview in full through the video above.</strong></p> <p><strong>Maksuda Abduqayumova spoke.</strong></p> <p><strong>Photographer and editing master Javahir Gayratov.</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/nodavlat-orta-talim-tashkilotlari-soni-600-taga-yetkaziladi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources.
