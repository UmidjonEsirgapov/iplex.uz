Below is a version of the article prepared on the basis of this text, which meets the requirements of SEO and is optimized for search engines.</p> <h1 data-path-to-node="2">Transformation in education: new trends in the evaluation system and international experience</h1> <p data-path-to-node="3">Today, the educational system of Uzbekistan is undergoing a period of radical change. The international forum on <b data-index-in-node="87" data-path-to-node="3">"Transformation of evidence-based education"</b> held in Tashkent was dedicated to the modernization of the assessment system. This event, which was organized in cooperation with the republican scientific-methodical center for the development of education and Tashkent University of Applied Sciences, was an important step towards ensuring the implementation of decision No. PQ-128.</p> <h2 data-path-to-node="4">Educational transformation: Why should the evaluation system change?</h2> <p data-path-to-node="5">As the participants of the forum noted, the quality of education is not only through teaching, but it is measured by how objectively the acquired knowledge is evaluated. The first deputy minister of pre-school and school education <b data-index-in-node="217" data-path-to-node="5">Sherzod Karimov</b> said that the era of "chasing numbers" has passed in the field, and now the main attention should be focused on students' ability to think critically.</p> <h3 data-path-to-node="6">Future teacher and artificial intelligence</h3> <p data-path-to-node="7">The idea put forward by the First Deputy Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation <b data-index-in-node="67" data-path-to-node="7">Sardor Rajabov</b> was one of the main theses of the forum:</p> <blockquote data-path-to-node="8"> <p data-path-to-node="8,0">"The future the teacher must have a perfect knowledge of working with artificial intelligence and digital platforms, modern assessment methods."</p> </blockquote> <p data-path-to-node="9">This requirement serves as the main bridge in ensuring coherence between higher education and the labor market.</p> <h2 data-path-to-node="10">International experience: PISA, PIRLS and Global Cooperation</h2> <p data-path-to-node="11">Representatives of the world's leading organizations such as <b data-index-in-node="8" data-path-to-node="11">UNESCO, UNICEF and Cambridge</b> expressed their attitude to the reforms in Uzbekistan. Discussions focused on the following tools:</p> <ul data-path-to-node="12"> <li> <p data-path-to-node="12,0,0"><b data-index-in-node="0" data-path-to-node="12,0,0">PISA and PIRLS:</b> Global comparison of education quality through international assessment programs.</p> </li> <li> <p data-path-to-node="12,1,0"><b data-index-in-node="0" data-path-to-node="12,1,0">Evidence-based approach:</b> Making decisions based on hard numerical analysis rather than emotions.</p> </li> <li> <p data-path-to-node="12,2,0"><b data-index-in-node="0" data-path-to-node="12,2,0">Gamification:</b> Reducing subjectivity by introducing game elements into the evaluation process.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 data-path-to-node="13">Methodological initiatives for 2025</h3> <p data-path-to-node="14">Director of the Center for Educational Development <b data-index-in-node="42" data-path-to-node="14">Yuliya Risyukova</b> announced that specific plans have been developed for the complete modernization of the system in 2025. In this process, one of the most important tasks was to ensure pedagogical continuity between school and university.</p> <h2 data-path-to-node="16">Conclusion</h2> <p data-path-to-node="17">This forum showed that the educational system of Uzbekistan is moving to a new stage - digital and evidence-based assessment system. By integrating artificial intelligence into education and introducing international standards, not only the quality of education will increase, but also the competitiveness of our youth in the world market will be ensured. After all, the correct grade is the foundation for the student's future success. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/asia-youth-international-mun-conference" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources..
