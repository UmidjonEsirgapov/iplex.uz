In each case, the approval of organizations of different levels (the Higher Education Commission, the Ministry) is required. Test scores are the deciding factor when transferring from a foreign or non-state HEI. The most important thing is to strictly follow all official procedures. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ushbu-abituriyentlar-imtihonlarisiz-yuridik-texnikumlarga-qabul-qilinadi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
