                Today's most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Is higher education absolutely free in Germany?</strong><br/><strong>That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany.</strong><br/><strong>Education through English in Germany, which offers exactly such a bachelor's course today: In many developed countries German universities also offer courses taught in English.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>The purpose of the post:</strong></p> <p>Through this post, <u>International Business Administration &amp; Let's take a look at the Entrepreneurship</u> <strong>bachelor</strong> course and the application process.</p> <p><strong>Is higher education in Germany </strong><strong>absolutely</strong><strong> free?</strong></p> <p>As we all know, Germany is one of the few countries where higher education is free for national and international students. In addition, it is considered one of the most developed countries in the world. It is natural for any person to have the desire to study in Germany at least once. Now the question arises, "Is education in Germany really completely free?" <u><strong>The answer is "Yes and No".</strong></u> I will try to give a full explanation below for the answer.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong></p> <p>Most universities in Germany (national and government funded) do not charge students a tuition fee. But students are required to pay the semester fee. The cost of the semester fee may vary from one university to another, but in most universities the amount of this fee does not exceed 250 euros per semester. We can say that education in Germany is free because it is not a big amount and this fee is charged for administrative work done by the university for the student. But not all universities in Germany are absolutely free. As an example, we can take universities in cities that are part of the German <strong>Baden-Wurttemberg</strong> region. These universities have started demanding tuition fees from international students for some courses from the 2017/18 academic year. That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany. But education in most universities is free, as we said above.</p> <p><strong>Education in Germany through English:</strong></p> <p>As in many developed countries, German universities offer courses taught in English. But the number of such courses for a bachelor's degree is significantly less than for a master's degree. But this does not mean that it does not exist at all. This is the kind of bachelor's course offered today</p> <p><strong>Education through English in Germany:</strong></p> <p>As in many developed countries, German universities offer courses taught in English. But the number of such courses for a bachelor's degree is significantly less than for a master's degree. But this does not mean that it does not exist at all. Today we will talk about the <strong>Leuphana University of Lüneburg</strong>, which offers such a bachelor's course, and the procedure for sending documents for the bachelor's course it offers.</p> <p><strong>Leuphana University of Lüneburg in brief:</strong></p> <p>This university is located in the city of <strong>Lüneburg</strong><strong> </strong>, Germany, and was founded in 1946. This university ranks #67 among German national universities.</p> <p><img alt="See the source image" src="https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/1400/81555f72256151.5be17a5339726.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>Course offered:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Bachelor of Science in International Business Administration &amp; Entrepreneurship</li> </ul> <p><strong>Curriculum language:</strong></p> <ul> <li>English</li> </ul> <p><strong>Duration:</strong></p> <ul> <li>6 semesters (3 years)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Curriculum fee:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Studying in this course is free</li> </ul> <p><strong>Requirements for applicants:</strong></p> <ol> <li>For almost all German universities, applicants are required to have a bachelor's degree or a bachelor's degree <u>(if the candidate completed an academic lyceum before entering the university)</u> and a bachelor's degree <u>(if the applicant completed a college before entering the university)</u> requires a transcript of grades. <strong>Same requirement for this course;</strong></li> <li>English language certificate - one of the following: <ul> <li>TOEFL iBT minimum score 97;</li> <li>TOEIC minimum score 850 (listening and reading) and 340 (speaking and writing);</li> <li>IELTS (academic) minimum score 6.5;</li> <li>CAE exam B level;</li> <li>FCE exam level A.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><strong>How to send the necessary documents:</strong></p> <p>Generally, applications for German universities are accepted in 2 ways:</p> <ol> <li>Directly to the university itself (Submit by mail, online or in person);</li> <li>Through the Uni-Assist system (Uni Assist is your chosen university sending you the documents organization that helps provide).
