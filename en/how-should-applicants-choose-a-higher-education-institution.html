                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Fee-contract or grant?</strong><br/><strong>Public or non-public HEIs?</strong><br/><strong>In the second case, you determine the level of convenience, but you will have to pay for this opportunity.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>To get a higher education so that you don't regret your time (and money!), ask yourself a few questions:</p> <p><strong>Which career do I like?</strong></p> <p>Choosing a higher education institution depends on what career you want to pursue. Let's say you decide to become a lawyer. Make a list of universities that train such specialists and analyze the pros and cons of each. Find out where the teaching staff is strongest, how training (internships) and internships take place, and what format lectures are held in. Pay attention to the requirements imposed by the management of the HEI on the discipline and educational process.</p> <p>The best way to get all the necessary information is to talk to graduates or current undergraduate students. Student brothers are very friendly and open and can never hide the problems that exist.</p> <p><strong>On the basis of fee-contract or grant?</strong></p> <p>Of course, each of us wants to study on the basis of grant and get education without worrying about paying for education. Unfortunately, places for the state grant are limited, and there are always many people who want to study. If you are accepted to study on the basis of a fee-contract, think about how you will pay it in advance and keep in mind that its price will increase at least once a year. Consider the fee-contract amount when choosing a higher education institution and a field of study.</p> <p><strong>State or private higher education institution? Local or foreign?</strong></p> <p>It all depends on your interests and opportunities. The main thing is that the educational institution has state accreditation.</p> <p><strong>Where do you live?</strong></p> <p>This applies to those who plan to study in another city. Dormitory or rented apartment? The first option will be cheaper and, of course, more fun, but you will have to adapt to the conditions there, including living conditions. In the second case, you determine the level of comfort yourself, but you will have to pay for this opportunity. Spoiler: your scholarship will definitely not be enough!</p> <p><u><strong>Analyze these and other factors and remember that you have exciting student years ahead of you, full of new knowledge, acquaintances and opportunities. Make the most of this time!</strong></u> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/keyingi-yildan-kollej-texnikumlar-qabulida-ham-testdan-keyin-yonalish-tanlanadi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources.
