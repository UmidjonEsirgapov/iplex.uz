Below are <strong>main rules</strong> for placing desks and tables and chairs:</p> <p>1️⃣ <strong>Distance between rows of two-seater tables</strong> should be at least <strong>60 cm</strong>. This ensures free movement of students.</p> <p>2️⃣ <strong>The distance between the rows of desks and the outer wall</strong> should be <strong>50-70 cm</strong>. This will help to provide proper light and air for students.</p> <p>3️⃣ <strong>The distance between the rows of desks and the inner wall, fence or cabinet</strong> should be at least <strong>50 cm</strong>. This ensures the safety of students.</p> <p>4️⃣ <strong>The distance between the last desk and the wall</strong> should be <strong>70 cm</strong>. This area allows easy movement for students.</p> <p>5️⃣ <strong>The distance between the blackboard and the first desk</strong> should be <strong>240 cm</strong>. This is necessary for students to see the blackboard correctly and effectively understand the lessons.</p> <p>6️⃣ <strong>The distance between the blackboard and the last desk</strong> should not exceed <strong>860 cm</strong>. This provides a comfortable distance for the eyes.</p> <p>7️⃣ <strong>The distance between the lower side of the board and the floor</strong> should be <strong>70-90 cm</strong>. This makes it easier for teachers and students to use the blackboard.</p> <h4>Conclusion</h4> <p>Following these rules will help create ergonomic conditions in classrooms. Properly arranged desks and tables make the learning process more efficient and comfortable. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/birlashgan-arab-amirliklarida-magistratura-va-doktorantura-bosqichlarida-mbzuai-scholarship-program-toliq-moliyalashtirilgan-grant-dasturi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How do you feel about this innovation?
