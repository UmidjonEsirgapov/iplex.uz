                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Because the work with students living in rented apartments in higher education institutions has not been systematically implemented and there are many problems in this regard. building "Social Houses" for rent is the most correct way.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Each time before the beginning of a new academic year, solving the problem of student dormitories is an urgent issue. After all, the work with students living in rented apartments in higher educational institutions is not organized systematically and there are many problems in this regard. The sad part is that the system of working with them is still lagging.</p> <p>Today, when you talk to students from the region who are studying in Tashkent, most of them say that they live in rented apartments, the prices of rented apartments are high, and the rented apartments are located far away from educational institutions. In this regard, providing housing for students today is an urgent issue that cannot be delayed.</p> <p>We all know that in his address to the Oliy Majlis this year, the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan stated that in his address to the Oliy Majlis this year, all facilities will be created for the education of our youth, who say that they will get a higher education, work on themselves and become knowledgeable, and that the level of coverage of school graduates with higher education will be at least 25% in 2020 and 50-60% in the future. </p> <p>Naturally, as the coverage increases, students' demand for housing also increases. According to the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education, there are currently 225 student residences in higher education institutions, which can accommodate about 60,000 students. This can cover only 30-35% of students who need to live in student housing.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, young people who are not provided with housing will be forced to rent private houses (apartments) in the domestic market. Students living in apartments are charged at least 2 million per month rent. starts from soum. If 4 people live, it is 500 thousand soums per person. Of course, excluding utility bills.</p> <p>Taking into account the above problems, I would like to offer the following in order to provide housing for students. In my opinion, the best way to do this is to build "Social Houses" for rent for students. To build such houses, first of all, it is carried out on the basis of support of the private sector or public-private partnership. For this, low interest and long-term loans should be allocated to entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Entrepreneurs submit their projects to the commission to build "social houses". The houses to be built in the project should be cheap, high-quality and meet the requirements, not burdensome in paying the rent. Most importantly, it is very important for students to have a large study hall, library and Wi-Fi in social houses.</p> <p>Students are accommodated in social houses on the basis of a contract. This serves to clearly define the rights and obligations of both parties in the contract, as well as prevent students from wandering around looking for rented accommodation and various unpleasant incidents. member — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/energy-globe-award" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
