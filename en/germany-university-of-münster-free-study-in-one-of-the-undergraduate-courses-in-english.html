                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Is higher education in Germany completely free?</strong><br/><strong>But students are required to pay a semester fee.</strong><br/><strong>Offered course: Bachelor of Science: Human Movement in Sports and Exercise (more) Curriculum language: English Duration: 6 semesters (3 years) Curriculum fee: This course is free of charge Application submission dates: Admission for international students opens on May 1, 2021 and continues until May 31 of this year. is one of the free <strong>bachelor</strong> courses taught in</strong> language and we will take a complete look at the application process. <p><strong>Is higher education in Germany </strong><strong>absolutely</strong><strong> free?</strong></p> <p>As we all know, Germany is one of the few countries where higher education is free for national and international students. In addition, it is considered one of the most developed countries in the world. It is natural for any person to have the desire to study in Germany at least once. Now the question arises, "Is education in Germany really completely free?" <u><strong>The answer is "Yes and No".</strong></u> I will try to give a full explanation below for the answer.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Note:</strong></p> <p>Most universities in Germany (national and government funded) do not charge students a tuition fee. But students are required to pay the semester fee. The cost of the semester fee may vary from one university to another, but in most universities the amount of this fee does not exceed 250 euros per semester. We can say that education in Germany is free because it is not a big amount and this fee is charged for administrative work done by the university for the student. But not all universities in Germany are absolutely free. As an example, we can take universities in cities that are part of the German <strong>Baden-Wurttemberg</strong> region. These universities have started demanding tuition fees from international students for some courses from the 2017/18 academic year. That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany. But education in most universities is free, as we said above.</p> <p><strong>Education in Germany through English:</strong></p> <p>As in many developed countries, German universities offer courses taught in English. But the number of such courses for a bachelor's degree is significantly less than for a master's degree. But this does not mean that it does not exist at all. Today we will talk about the <strong>University of Münster</strong>, which offers such a bachelor's course, and the procedure for sending documents for the bachelor's course it offers.</p> <p><strong>Brief about the University of Munster:</strong></p> <p>This university is located in the city of <strong>Münster</strong>, Germany, and is the fifth largest university in Germany. It ranks <strong>#195 in the ranking of world universities provided by <strong>THE</strong> (Times Higher Education). </strong> Human Movement in Sports and Exercise (<strong>details</strong>)  <p><strong>Curriculum language:</strong></p> <ul> <li>English</li> </ul> <p><strong>Duration:</strong></p> <ul> <li>6 semesters (3 years)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Curriculum fee:</strong></p> <ul> <li>In this course tuition is free</li> </ul> <p><strong>Application dates:</strong></p> <p>Admission for international students <strong>opens on May 1, 2021 and continues until May 31 of this year.</strong></p> <p><strong>Requirements for candidates:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Bachelor degree or first bachelor degree from almost all German universities. requires an extract from the rating grades on completion of <u>(if the candidate completed the academic lyceum before entering the university)</u>, as well as completion of the second stage of the bachelor's degree <u>(if the candidate completed the college before entering the university)</u>. <strong>The same is required for this course;</strong></li> <li>Good knowledge of English (language certificate is desirable);</li> </ol> <p><strong>Required documents:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Extract of diploma or first/second year rating grades (in case of translation);</li> <li>Completed university application form;</li> <li>Passport copy;</li> <li>Motivational letter (some departments may not ask for it);</li> <li>Recommendation (some departments may not ask for it);</li> </ol> <p>You can check other additional documents <strong>here</strong> after the admission for the course has started.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>More details here</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/andijonda-xorijiy-otm-filiali-tashkil-etildi-qabul-shu-yildan-boshlanadi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources.</p>
