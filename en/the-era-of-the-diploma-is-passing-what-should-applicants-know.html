                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>What is important is skills, experience and work on yourself.</strong><br/><strong>This is wrong and will not happen again.</strong><br/><strong>If it is important, you should get higher education.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>Highly educated Gone are the days when being a teacher guaranteed a well-paying job. Now the diploma is not as important as before. What is important is qualifications, experience and self-improvement.</h4> <p>Applicants hope that higher education will pave the way for a better future for them. But in the current conditions, only having a diploma after receiving higher education is not enough to find a place in the labor market.</p> <p>Now the labor market requires qualified personnel for itself, and the diploma is losing its first-class importance.</p> <div id="native_video"></div> <p><strong>1.6 million of the population of Uzbekistan are unemployed</strong></p> <p>It was said at the plenary session of the Senate. As of January 1, 2021, 1.6 million of the economically active population of the republic are unemployed. 805,200 of them are young people, i.e. citizens between the ages of 16 and 30. The numbers related to the labor resource are increasing year by year.</p> <p>In the concept of the development of the higher education system until 2030, the level of inclusion of young people with higher education is set to reach 50% by 2030. In 2020, this indicator was 25 percent.</p> <p>So, after 8 years, the number of personnel with higher education will almost double (even more due to personnel trained by private universities). This means that a strong struggle will begin for personnel to earn a living in the market. In order to win the fight and get a job, it is more important to be a qualified person, not just a diploma.</p> <p><strong>"A diploma will not solve anything in the near future" - Abduvali Khalikov</strong></p> <p><img alt="" src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/7/nrN_1gbT10qqHhloFnKFLWchLo448GZq.jpg"/></p> <p>"The credit-module system will be introduced for first-year students of all HEIs. In order to study in this system, the student needs to work more on himself. If he doesn't work on himself, the possibility of him dropping out of the course will increase and he will be given 8 years to complete his studies," said Abduvali Khalikov, the head of the main department of the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education, who informed about the transition to a new system in higher education in an interview. This is wrong and will not happen again. Currently, the number of students in HEIs is sufficient. 5-6 years ago, there were opinions that if students were fired, the staff would shrink. Now both students and parents should think about not only getting a diploma, but also about becoming a good specialist in the future.</p> <p>A diploma will not solve anything in the near future. The reason is that when the number of personnel increases, the competition also increases. Taking into account that the need is 50-60 thousand, so many personnel were prepared, and this means that only one person applied for a job at one place. If 5-6 graduates go to one place by themselves, the employer here also thinks and hires those who will benefit him. As a result, the rest of the graduates who could not get a job study in the second specialty, and if they study, they study better. Or he goes to training courses and works on himself.</p> <p>Those who get a job also work on themselves, because he does not want to give his place to someone who will come after him", - says Abduvali Khalikov.</p> <p><strong>Or the choice of migration...</strong></p> <p>Recently, an acquaintance of mine went to work in Russia. Now he is working at a wood processing plant located in a forest far from the country's cities. He is a highly educated person.</p> <p>According to the information provided by the Foreign Labor Migration Agency, in the first 5 months of 2021, 17,350 citizens were employed abroad by the agency. Most of them found work in Russia and Kazakhstan.</p> <p>These numbers refer to the migrants sent by the agency to work, and the number of people who went abroad to work is undoubtedly much higher. src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/7/6LGFvXHEyEv1OeiObjjABe_pR-DbsJxt.jpg"/&gt;</p> <p><em>Firuz Allayev, founder of the Asakhiy.uz project:</em></p> <p>- First of all, let's answer the question whether it is necessary to get a higher education in order to find a job in the labor market. If you want to become a physicist, a doctor, a political scientist or a lawyer, these professions cannot be acquired without a higher education. That is why the first question should be asked correctly: is a diploma important for the profession I am choosing or not? If it is important, you should get a higher education.</p> <p>But for some professions, for example, for a marketer, his ability to correctly formulate a marketing strategy and organize sales is more important than a diploma. Or, for a programmer, being able to write the right code is more important than a degree. However, if higher education is necessary to get a professional qualification, then it is necessary to study.</p> <p>However, after graduating from school, there is pressure on an 18-year-old child to either study or get married and earn money somewhere. As a result, a child who is not enrolled in school is forced to quickly enter adult life. A student studying in higher education will have 4 years to work on himself. Therefore, a young person who wants to become a programmer can enter higher education and try to learn the skills he needs, even if it is somewhere else. In addition, getting a higher education will help to become the elite layer of the country in the future. It gives an opportunity to get to know each other, to network and to find good partners in the future.</p> <p>In my opinion, if a diploma is mandatory for the chosen profession, higher education is a must. If the profession does not require a diploma, it can be obtained in other ways. Qualification is important. The reason is that it doesn't matter if they have a diploma or not, now only those who are qualified and professional in their profession can find a good job and live well. <p><em>Dildora Otajonova, head of the Teodora Goods enterprise, author of the Dalatech project:</em></p> <p>- For me, the diploma is not in the first place, I choose those who come to work based on their qualifications. Even the employees I work with now do not have a higher education degree, but they are doing their jobs well.</p> <p>I think it is enough for the employees to go to short-term courses to get the qualifications and get the necessary skills. The important thing is the result, not the diploma.</p> <p><strong>"Because I didn't have a diploma, I couldn't get a government job, but found a job in the private sector." <p>— I think that there is still an opinion in society that a diploma is better than a qualification. The reason is that those who want to work in state organizations are often asked about their qualifications and their diploma before they are even interested in that profession. For this reason, people have formed the view that a diploma is the most important thing, and I think that this is not going away from their minds. It would be more useful if the interests and skills of the employees were primarily interested in the workplace.</p> <p>Now there are personnel who know several languages ​​and are familiar with information technology, although they have a secondary education. They got a job without being able to get higher education due to family circumstances or other reasons. The private sector is currently employing such personnel. For example, in 2014, I started working in the field of journalism because I was not able to enter the OTM, and I still cannot enter a higher education institution, because I did not have the opportunity to prepare separately for entering the OTM. But I don't regret it. Now I have my own job.</p> <p>However, because I did not have a diploma of higher education at that time, I could not get a job in Andijan regional publications, after that I started working in private organizations.</p> <p>According to my observations, the promotion of the position in state organizations depends more on the availability of a diploma, a master's degree. But it would be more appropriate if the main attention was focused on the qualification of the employee.</p> <p><strong>The amount of salary is measured by the level of qualification</strong></p> <p>Qualification is so important that it determines how much salary you will receive and what kind of success you will get.</p> <p>For example, if you are a professional doctor, you will not work for a very low salary in a family polyclinic (the average monthly salary of medical staff is 2 million soums, (they are among the lowest paid) you can work in private hospitals. They have a higher salary and a higher chance of making a career.</p> <p>Or if you are a teacher, you can open a separate training center yourself or get a job in one of these centers and teach as you want.</p> <p>So, if you look for it, you will find an opportunity. It is only appropriate to give great importance to interests when choosing a profession, and to prioritize the acquisition of qualifications in education.</p> <p>By the way, it was reported at the plenary session of the Senate that 19,177 vacant jobs requiring higher education in the Unified National Labor System managed by the Ministry of Employment and Labor Relations will receive <strong>1 million. up to 2 million soums,</strong> for 26,754 vacant jobs, a salary of <strong>up to 2 million soums</strong> has been offered.</p> <p>So, now there are about 46,000 vacant jobs for people with higher education in Uzbekistan. But the Senate said that this salary does not satisfy the graduates who studied under contract. But such a salary will not satisfy not only those who paid for the contract, but also those who studied on the grant.</p> <p>So, the choice is in your hands. If you want, get a good education (either in higher education institutions or directly on the job) and reach the level you set for yourself monthly. If you don't want to do this, then you may have a diploma, but there are jobs with a salary of 1-2 million soums waiting for you. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/4/4-sinf-oqish-metodika" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p></strong></p></p>
