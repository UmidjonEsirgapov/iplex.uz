                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>In the study transfer exam, the same subjects will be tested in the subjects that were taken in the previous year's admission.</strong><br/><strong>For example, in the 2022/2023 admission to legal departments, the history and English language exam will be taken. </strong><br/><strong>Not from the subject of jurisprudence.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Examinations will be made from the same subjects that were taken in the previous year's admission.</p> <p>For example, in the 2022/2023 admission to the legal departments, an exam was taken on history and English language. And according to the procedure, for this year's "perevod" students, there should be an exam in history and English. Not from the science of law.</p> <p>However, until July 15, the Ministry of Higher Education will separately announce which subject will be examined when transferring studies to which direction. Therefore, the most accurate information can be found from the announcement of the ministry. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/cefr-imtihoni-haqida-gaplashamiz" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
