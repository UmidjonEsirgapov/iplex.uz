                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>According to it, the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan dated November 19, 2021 "On measures to introduce the procedure for taking into account the grades of applicants on their educational documents in the entrance exams to higher education institutions" became invalid.</strong><br/><strong>What was the planned system of school grades?</strong><br/><strong>According to the decision announced in 2021, starting from the 2023/2024 school year, the grades of the applicants in the certificate should be taken into account as follows: for 3 grades - 3 points for 4 grades - 4 points for 5 grades - 5 points That is, if the applicant gets 130 points from the test, it is planned to add 3 to 5 points depending on his average grade.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Starting from 2025, school grades will not be included in the test scores</h2> <h3>The decision of 2021 was canceled by the presidential decree</h3> <p>On July 19, 2025, the presidential decree (PF-114) was accepted. According to it, the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan dated November 19, 2021 <strong>"On measures to introduce the procedure for taking into account the evaluations of applicants' educational documents in entrance exams to higher education institutions"</strong> will become invalid.</p> <p>According to this decision, in previous years it was planned that the applicants' school grades - that is, the average of the last 6 years in grades 7-11 - would be added to the entrance scores.</p> <h3>What was the planned system for school grades?</h3> <p>According to the decision announced in 2021, from the 2023/2024 academic year, the applicant's certificate grades will be as follows should be taken into account:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>for 3 marks</strong> — 3 points</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>for 4 marks</strong> — 4 points</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>for 5 marks</strong> — 5 points</p> </li> </ul> <p>That is, if the applicant gets 130 points from the test, he is given 3 out of 5 depending on his average grade </p> <p>However, this system was delayed for another two years in 2023.</p> <h3>From 2025, the grades will not affect the test</h3> <p>Now, starting from the 2025/2026 school year, the grades obtained during schooling will not play any role in entering a higher education institution. Only the points obtained in the tests are taken into account.</p> <p>This news can be a relief for many applicants, especially for those who did not get high grades at school, but are ready to show high results in the test.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>With the new presidential decree, the evaluation system in the process of entering higher education has been simplified. Applicants' school grades are no longer taken into account. This serves to create a fair and equal competitive environment based on test results. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oliygoh/samarqand-davlat-veterinariya-meditsinasi-chorvachilik-va-biotexnologiyalar-universiteti" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
