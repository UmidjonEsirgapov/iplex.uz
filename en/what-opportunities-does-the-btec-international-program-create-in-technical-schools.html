                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>How effective is the international program "BTEC" introduced in technical schools?</strong><br/><strong>At the initial stage, this program will be implemented as an experiment in 14 technical schools.</strong><br/><strong>The main results expected from the program: Compatibility of education: Vocational education programs are compatible and having continuity, graduates will have the opportunity to continue from a certain stage of the bachelor's degree based on the acquired modules and accumulated credits. At the initial stage, this program will be introduced <strong>in 14 technical schools as an experiment</strong>. The BTEC program gives graduates a diploma recognized in 70 countries and provides access to more than 200 foreign universities. Pearson is a leading international educational organization with 784 centers around the world and 90% of its graduates are employed. This program makes it possible to adjust the training period in technical schools depending on the complexity of the profession and the student's level of education. For example, a graduate of the 9th grade studies for 3 years, and a graduate of the 11th grade studies for 3 years, and a graduate of the 11th grade studies for 3 years. <h3><strong>The main results expected from the program:</strong></h3> <ul> <li><strong>Compatibility of education</strong>: Vocational education programs have mutual compatibility and coherence, and the modules mastered by the graduates when transitioning to higher education and will be able to continue from a certain stage of the bachelor's degree based on the accumulated credits.</li> <li><strong>Independence of technical schools will be expanded</strong>: Technical schools will be able to change the number of subjects and hours by up to 30%, produce and sell products. They also have the right to train personnel according to the order of employers on the basis of a contract.</li> <li><strong>Employers are widely involved in the training process</strong>: Training programs are formed based on the demands of employers. As a result, the needs of middle-level personnel in certain regions will be met.</li> <li><strong>The final certification system</strong> will be updated: The knowledge and skills of graduates will be evaluated through practical exams with the participation of employers.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Program impact</strong>: The possibilities of placement of graduates of technical schools based on the "BTEC" program in high-paying jobs in <strong>developed countries</strong> increases. Also, the qualification of 180 pedagogues will be improved and 1,680 students will be admitted to study per year. 50 billion soums will be allocated to the fund from the extra-budgetary fund of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, and another 50 billion soums will be allocated from the state budget in 2025.
