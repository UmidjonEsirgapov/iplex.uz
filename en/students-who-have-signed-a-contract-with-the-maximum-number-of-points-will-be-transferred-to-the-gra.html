                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Work is underway to separate the quotas of the Temurbek school. "The problem of the remaining 5 people will be solved today or tomorrow," he said. After the announcement of the mandate, public objections were raised about applicants who received the maximum number of points to study on the basis of a contract and the privilege given to the graduates of "Temurbek School". These students will be transferred to a grant based on the privilege given by the president. Work is being carried out to separate the quotas of the "Temurbek School". <p>According to the order of the President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, the next report of the State Commission on admission to educational organizations was adopted. This was reported by the press secretary of the Prime Minister, Bekzod Hidoyatov.</p> <p>According to him, the following applicants who scored the highest - 189 points for the "International Relations" course (Uzbek group) of the University of World Economy and Diplomacy, but were recommended on a fee-contract basis, will study on the basis of a state grant under the privilege given by the president:</p> <ul> <li>Ahatova Aziza Shuhrat daughter;</li> <li>Abdulvahidova, daughter of Muhaiyokhan Lutfullo;</li> <li>Khojabekov Ubaydullo Nematovich;</li> <li>Ergasheva Mukhlisa Azizbek daughter;</li> <li>Son of Tilavoldiyev Sanjar Zafarjon.</li> </ul> <p>We remind that graduates of "Temurbek School" were collected by themselves in military educational institutions. 30 percent of the points, and 15 percent of the other higher education institutions are given additional points. It is precisely because of this category of privileged applicants that 6 applicants who were sent to the University of World Economy and Diplomacy were admitted to study on the basis of a contract, even though they scored 189 points. It is reported that a regular working procedure is being launched to prevent similar cases. In fact, there were 6 people who got the maximum points and were admitted to study under the contract. We solved the problem of a student from Karakalpakstan. The problem of the remaining 5 will be solved today or tomorrow," he said.</p> <p>After the announcement of the mandate, public objections were raised about the applicants who got the maximum number of points and enrolled on the basis of the contract and the privilege given to the graduates of the Temurbek School.
