                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The 2023 passing score for the quota based on the additional state grant given to the children of the military. Regardless, 777 applicants who received the highest score among the 2,000 children of military personnel who received a recommendation in the system of the Ministry of Defense entered the first course of their choice under an additional quota based on a state grant. <p>This preferential quota is valid only for the first route. Second, third, etc. does not apply to courses.</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/5/1100__UW1Wg4aswJJzij75dj6by0t3v4cLBKqW.png"/></p> <p>Also, this additional quota applies only to full-time education.</p> <p><strong>There is only the name of the organization and the passing score here, but neither There are no HEIs or directions?</strong></p> <p>The preferential quota is not given in the section of HEIs or directions, but in the section of organizations. How will it be?</p> <p>For example, 777 places were given to the Ministry of Defense. Let's say that a total of 2,000 referrals were issued for children of employees in the Ministry of Defense system (this is just an example, in fact it may be more or less). It doesn't matter which HEI they choose as their first major. For example, someone chose the Law University, someone the Medical Academy, someone the Financial Institute, etc. It doesn't matter which courses they choose.</p> <p>Thus, regardless of the higher education institution they chose, 777 applicants who got the highest scores among the 2,000 children of military men who received a recommendation in the system of the Ministry of Defense entered the first course of their choice with an additional quota based on the state grant. The remaining 1,223 applicants competed with everyone in the general order according to the scores they had collected. If there is enough, they may also have entered into a grant or contract.</p> <p><strong>Does the recommendation given to the children of military personnel add points?</strong></p> <p>No, no points are added. They compete with their points. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/avstraliya-charles-darwin-universiteti-tomonidan-bakalavr-va-magistratura-kurslari-uchun-7500-lik-grant-dasturi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
