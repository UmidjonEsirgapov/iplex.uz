                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>According to the rules of previous years, if the applicant scored less than the minimum 56.7 points, he was granted the right to study by paying 2 times the highest contract amount set for his field.</strong><br/><strong>An applicant who scored less than the minimum score and he had the opportunity to become a student by paying twice this amount (about 441 million soums).</strong><br/><strong>What will be the situation in 2025?</strong><br/><hr/> <h3>About the minimum score and the super-contract procedure</h3> <p>One of the most frequently asked questions among applicants is whether <strong>those who could not score the minimum score can also become a student through the "super-contract" can they be?</strong></p> <p>According to the rules of the previous years, if the applicant scored <strong>less than the minimum 56.7 points</strong>, he was granted the right to be a student by paying <strong>2 times the highest contract amount</strong> set for his field.</p> <h3>As an example</h3> <p>For example, <strong>in 2022 in the field of jurisprudence, the amount of the super-contract is set at 220.7 million soums. An applicant who scored less than the minimum score had the opportunity to become a student by paying <strong>double</strong> of this amount (that is, about 441 million soums).</strong></p> <h3>What is the situation in 2025?</h3> <p>So far, the "super-contract" procedure for this year has <strong>not been officially approved</strong>. Therefore, applicants will be able to find out the final decision after the <strong>Decision of the Cabinet</strong> is announced.</p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>The possibility of admission to the applicants who scored less than the minimum score was available in previous years, but this year's procedure is not yet clear. Therefore, it is necessary to wait for the official decision and then make a decision. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/talaba-otm-ichida-yonalishini-ozgartira-oladimi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.
