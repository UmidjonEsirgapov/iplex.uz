                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Specific example: Jurisprudence field Let's look at an example: General state grant quota in the field of jurisprudence: 145 Grant share limit for jurisprudence: 10% Tashkent State Law University (TDYU) total quota: 595 If in the field of jurisprudence if the share of the grant is set to a maximum of 10%, this means: TDYU can receive grant places in this direction only up to 10% of the total quota.</strong><br/><strong>In this case, the grant allocation limit is calculated as follows: 10% × 595 = 59.5 ≈ 60 grants So, a maximum of 60 applicants for jurisprudence at TDYU can study on the basis of a state grant It is possible.</strong><br/><strong>Summary The state grant share limit is the maximum limit set in the allocation of grant places for universities, which serves to ensure equality and balance the allocation of grants.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>What is the state grant share limit?</h2> <p>One of the most common concepts that applicants encounter in the process of admission to higher education institutions is - <strong>state grant share limit</strong>. This term is one of the important criteria for admission parameters and means the <strong>maximum limit of grant places</strong> allocated in each HEI. That is, it is shown what percentage of the <strong>total quota allocated to a specific educational field of a higher education institution can be a grant</strong>.</p> <h3>Exact example: Jurisprudence field</h3> <p>Let's consider this in an example:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Total state grant quota in the field of jurisprudence: <strong>145 ta</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>Grant share limit for jurisprudence: <strong>10%</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>Tashkent State Law University (TDYU) total quota: <strong>595 ta</strong></p> </li> </ul> <p>If the grant share in the field of jurisprudence is set to a maximum of 10%, this means: <strong>TDYU grants in this direction seats can be taken only up to 10% of the total quota.</strong></p> <h3>How is it calculated?</h3> <p>550 of the total 595 quotas allocated to TDYU are for jurisprudence. In this case, the grant allocation limit is calculated as follows:</p> <p><strong>10% × 595 = 59.5 ≈ 60 grants</strong> Another 490 places will be on a contract basis.</p> <h3>Where will the other grants go?</h3> <p>60 of the total 145 grants allocated according to jurisprudence belong to TDYU, and the remaining <strong>85 will be distributed to other universities</strong>. These grants are distributed to other universities among high-scoring applicants.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p><strong>The state grant share limit</strong> is the maximum limit set for the distribution of grant places for universities, which serves to ensure equality and balance grant allocation. Applicants will be able to make an informed choice if they know in advance the limit of the grant share of the HEI they are choosing. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oqishdan-chetlatilgan-talabalar-qancha-muddatda-oqishini-tiklashi-kerak" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
