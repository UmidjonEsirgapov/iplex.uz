                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>It is better to write by hand.</strong><br/><strong>Buy a printer During the study period, you will have to print a lot of documents: abstracts, reports, coursework, thesis.</strong><br/><strong>Communicate and be active. participate in student-organized events to expand, make connections that you may need in the future, and show off your talent.</strong><br/><hr/> <p dir="auto">About making studying an easy and enjoyable process, not facing problems in the session and making the most of all opportunities.</p> <h2 dir="auto" id="Use-social-networks-and-messengers">Social networks and messengers use</h2> <p dir="auto">Create a Telegram group and invite all your classmates to it. Through this, you can get to know everyone faster, share the lesson schedule, scanned versions of documents <em>(nowadays, photos taken by smartphone cameras are no exception)</em> and share important announcements.</p> <p dir="auto">In addition, through this messenger, which is preferred by most of the students, it is possible to exchange messages on general issues in the group and post urgent messages.</p> <h2 dir="auto" id="Learn-better-about-your-teachers">Learn-better-about-your-teachers</h2> <p dir="auto">Write down the names and phone numbers of all your teachers. When they are late, you can always call to find out if there will be class or not. This will save you from waiting in vain.</p> <p dir="auto">Additional information will not be superfluous. Ask your seniors how certain teachers feel about lateness, how they behave on exams, and who they automatically grade. This information will save you from potential problems with demanding teachers.</p> <h2 dir="auto" id="Be sure to hand-write-the-outline">Be sure to hand-write the outline</h2> <p dir="auto">Some students just sit staring into space with the recorder on during lectures. You don't do that! A student who sits passively listens to teachers' jokes, absorbs information relatively poorly, and when he wants to repeat the lecture, he has to listen to it again in its entirety.</p> <p dir="auto">It is better to write it down by hand. Research shows that students who take notes by hand absorb information better than those who type on a computer. In the notebook, you can draw diagrams and put symbols, shorten sentences, add pictures - all this will help you remember information better and spend less time repeating it.</p> <h2 dir="auto" id="Submit your essay and coursework on time">Submit your essay and coursework on time</h2> <p dir="auto">The nervous-emotional tension increases during the session, in addition "tails" make the situation even more difficult. In such cases, you can easily bring yourself to depression and emotional holes.</p> <p dir="auto">According to the research, 34-40% of medical higher education students suffer from this problem. Burnout is also observed among students of other faculties, and it often occurs against the background of high workloads during the session.</p> <p dir="auto">Start preparing in advance to avoid increasing stress. Then you won't have to spend the whole night writing a low-quality work and the next day looking for a place to print it.</p> <h2 dir="auto" id="Buy a printer">Buy a printer</h2> <p dir="auto">During the study period, you will have to print a lot of documents: abstracts, reports, term papers, diploma work. Some work may need to be reprinted multiple times, everyone makes mistakes, and no one is immune.</p> <h2 dir="auto" id="Intervaled-revisions-do-do">Do Intervaled-revisions</h2> <p dir="auto">Refer to your notes periodically throughout the semester rather than re-studying everything before the exam. Use the interval repetition technique: repeat the information at increasing intervals, when you start to forget.</p> <p dir="auto">For example, repeat the topic for the first time a week after the lecture, then - after two weeks, after 1 month, after 2 months. Gradually, your knowledge is stored in long-term memory. Before the exam, it's enough to just jog your memory instead of reviewing all the material again.</p> <h2 dir="auto" id="Communicate-and-be-active">Communicate and be active</h2> <p dir="auto">Participate in activities organized by students to expand your communication circle, make connections that you may need in the future, and show off your talent. If you like organizational work, become a member of the student council. Through this, you will be among the first to hear about contests, grants, and trips, and learn how to organize events.</p> <p dir="auto">If you like public speaking - take part in QVZ <em>(KVN)</em>s, if you want to show your knowledge and ingenuity - take part in Zakovat games and Olympiads, if you are good at a sport - take part in competitions on behalf of OO'U. Each of these activities will ensure you make new friends, discover new opportunities, and get a good attitude from the dean's office.</p> <h2 dir="auto" id="Think-about-your-future">Think about your future</h2> <p dir="auto">Many people see higher education as an opportunity to extend their childhood, and after graduation, they have no idea what to do.</p> <p dir="auto">In order to avoid such a mistake, clarify what you will do at the next stage already in your first year: continue your studies in a master's degree, PhD, engage in scientific activities, work in a prestigious company or start your own company. The years of study at the Higher Education Institution go by very quickly. Without a clear plan, you risk wasting your time.</p> <p dir="auto">Socialize as much as possible, attend seminars and masterclasses, gain experience in the field you want to work in, and try never to resume your research in this direction when you realize that you have chosen the wrong path. Appreciate your time, and you will turn from a lucky student to a valuable professional.</p> <p dir="auto">Thank you for your attention!</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>Source:</strong> @itspecuz — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/nufuzli-xalqaro-olimpiadalar-goliblariga-tolanadigan-pul-mukofotlari-elon-qilindi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How do you feel about this news?
