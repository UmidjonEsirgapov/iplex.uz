                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Based on their capabilities and financial situation, they can choose one of the following ways: A) Continue studying at the current higher education institution. </strong><br/><strong>B) Transfer of studies on the basis of a super-contract. The super-contract system allows a student to transfer his studies to another higher education institution according to the established procedure, even if he does not pass the exam. </strong><br/><strong>Type 3 super-contract If a student has scored less than 56.7 points, he can also transfer his studies on the basis of a super-contract.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Summer study transfer process</strong> is the focus of attention of applicants and students. There are several <strong>alternative options</strong> for students who fail the exam. Based on their capabilities and financial situation, they can choose one of the following ways:</p> <h2><strong>A) Continue studying at the current higher education institution</strong></h2> <p>If the student <strong>does not pass the summer transfer exam</strong>, he can continue his studies at the <strong>higher education institution</strong> he is studying at the same time. This way is the cheapest and simplest option. B) Transfer of studies based on super-contract. The super-contract is divided into three categories:</p> <p><strong>Type 1 super-contract</strong> If the student <strong>fails to reach the passing score of 4.05 points</strong>, the following rates apply:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Up to 1.05 points: <strong>1.5 times</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>1.06-2.05 points: <strong>2 times</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>2.06–3.05 points: <strong>2.5 times</strong></p> </li> <li> <p>3.06–4.05 points: <strong>3 times</strong></p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a normal contract is 7,400,000 soums, 1.5 points are not enough. the remaining student pays <strong>14,800,000 soums</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Type 2 super-contract</strong> If the student <strong>failed to reach 4.05 points or more</strong>, but scored <strong>more than 56.7 points in total</strong>, the super-contract is as follows:</p> <table class="w-fit min-w-(--thread-content-width)"> <thead> <tr> <th data-col-size="sm">Direction</th> <th data-col-size="md">Super-contract (versus ordinary contract)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td data-col-size="sm">Economy, medicine, technology</td> <td data-col-size="md"><strong>8–25 times</strong> up to</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the normal contract is 10,500,000 soums, then 10 times the super-contract = <strong>105,000,000 soums</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Type 3 super-contract</strong> If the student <strong>less than 56.7 points has collected, he can transfer his studies on the basis of a super-contract. In this case:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>It will be 2 times</strong> the amount of the 2nd category contract.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the price of the 2nd category is 105,000,000 soums, the super-contract for this category = <strong>210,000,000 soums</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Important note:</strong> Regardless of <strong>how much less than the passing score</strong>, super-contract of category 2 and 3 is determined <strong>based on the same rate</strong>.</p> <p>The student can <strong>independently calculate</strong> the price of super-contract based on his/her points. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/magistraturaga-qabul-va-kirish-imtihonlari-haqida-batafsil" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
