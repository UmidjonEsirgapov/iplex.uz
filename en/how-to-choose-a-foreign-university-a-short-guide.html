                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>How to choose a university abroad When considering how to choose an institution abroad, follow these criteria: Criterion 1.</strong><br/><strong>The cost of living also varies by country, and in all countries living in big cities is more expensive than living in small towns or rural areas. If the article was useful, don't forget to share it with your friends and acquaintances. Holders of foreign degrees have the opportunity to stay in the country of their studies and have a wide career in their country. <p><u>How to choose a foreign institution?</u> Here are some basic criteria, if you pay attention to them, it will be easier to find the country and university of your dreams:</p> <p><strong>How to choose a country</strong>When choosing a country, clarify the following questions for yourself:</p> <p><strong>Criteria 1. Language. Language is the first selection criterion; you must master it at a high level and have an appropriate language certificate.</strong></p> <p><strong>Criteria 2. Which country and culture are closer to you?</strong>When you go to study in another country, you will inevitably encounter a new way of life, ethics and culture of communication, even a way of dressing. Learn more about the country and, if possible, visit it before making your final choice.</p> <p><strong>Criterion 3. Study duration and cost, overall budget.</strong>The length of the program will determine how quickly you can start working and recoup your investment in your education. Due to the high intensity of the program, British universities are usually a year shorter than in other countries.</p> <p>We recommend that you plan your overall budget, determine whether it is realistic and affordable, and it is also a good idea to look for additional sources of funding.</p> <p><strong>Criterion 4. The possibility of direct entry.</strong>After school, applicants from the Russian Federation and the CIS cannot always enter the first year of the chosen university directly; for example, in Great Britain, Austria, they need a year of study, during which they take the missing hours in subjects and improve their language skills.</p> <p><strong>Criterion 5. Plans after graduation.</strong>Most graduates plan to stay to work abroad. The duration of the extension of the residence permit for job seekers depends on the country and specialization they choose. In many countries, STEM professionals are a priority for employment. For example, they can stay in the US for 3 years to look for work. Preferred careers are also available in the Netherlands, Germany, Canada and other countries.</p> <p><strong>How to choose a university abroad</strong>When considering how to choose an institution abroad, consider the following criteria:</p> <p><u><strong>Criteria 1. The reputation of the university, the quality of the educational and scientific base.</strong></u>General information about these factors is given in the international ratings. We recommend that you pay attention not only to the place of the university in the general rating, but also in the rating by subject areas.</p> <p><strong><u>Criteria 2. Having a relevant program, internship, student exchange programs, supervisor and/or research team involved in the desired research.</u></strong></p> <p><u><strong>Criteria 3. Cost of education and living, availability of scholarships.</strong></u>According to the rule, the difference in the prices of universities occupying high places and places outside the second hundred of the ranking can reach 35-50%. The cost of living also varies by country, and in all countries, living in big cities is more expensive than living in small towns or rural areas. The price difference can reach 40%.</p> <p>Universities sometimes provide partial and less often full scholarships for undergraduate and graduate students. It is more difficult to get scholarships for undergraduates, because there are fewer offers at this level of education.</p> <p><u><strong>Criterion 4. The location of the university, living conditions.</strong></u>According to the methods of organizing the training and placement of students and teachers, the main types of universities include: city, town, college. The type of university largely determines the organization of the educational process, living conditions, recreation, the availability of cities and objects that interest you.</p> <p><u><strong>5th criterion. Statistics on the employment of graduates, their satisfaction with their studies, students who have completed their studies.</strong></u>This information helps to assess career prospects. Ask the representatives of the university everything you are interested in directly from the page in our search engine.</p> <p><strong>How to choose a university in Europe</strong>Despite the participation of European countries in the Bologna process, national education systems and teaching methods differ from each other. After graduating from a university in the UK, the Netherlands or Germany, you may have the same or comparable degree, but the content of the programs and teaching methods will be different.</p> <p>Follow the above criteria when choosing a university in Europe. Keep in mind that English is the most expensive and demanding language of instruction, and other languages ​​are cheaper. Often you can learn a new language from scratch within 1.5-2 years in the preparatory program of the university you are interested in.</p> <p>Good luck!</p> <p>If the article was useful, do not forget to share it with your friends and acquaintances.</p> <p>The article was translated into Uzbek by Dilshoda Khudoynazarova.
