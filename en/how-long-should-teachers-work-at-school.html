                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Also, the working hours of teachers are determined based on the work rate and workload they receive.</strong><br/><strong>If a high school teacher teaches 10 hours, it is enough for him to work 18 hours a week.</strong><br/><strong>A teacher with a 30-hour teaching load must work 54 hours a week.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Teachers' working hours at the school</strong> depend on their workload and this is clearly defined in the school's <strong>internal labor regulations</strong>. According to Article 174 of the Labor Code, the working order is determined by agreement with the trade union or the representative body of employees. Also, the working hours of teachers are determined based on their <strong>work rate</strong> and workload.</p> <p>For example, teachers who work 1 rate (20 hours in upper grades, 18 hours in elementary grades) must work <strong>36 hours</strong> per week. If a teacher teaches for 10 hours, he is not required to stay at school all day. The working time is determined based on the pedagogical load.</p> <p>If a high school teacher teaches <strong>10 hours</strong>, it is enough for him to work 18 hours a week. A teacher with a 30-hour teaching load should work <strong>54 hours</strong> a week. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/bazi-litsenziyaga-ega-xususiy-oliygoh-talabalari-diplom-ololmasligi-mumkin" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
