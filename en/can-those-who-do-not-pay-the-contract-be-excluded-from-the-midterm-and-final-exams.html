                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Non-payment of the contract cannot be the reason for not admitting the student to the final and midterm exams.</strong><br/><strong>50% payment: At least half of the contract payment is made by January 1.</strong><br/><strong>100% payment: Full payment It should be done by July 1.</strong><br/><hr/> <h3>Student rights: Can those who do not pay the contract be expelled from the exams?</h3> <p>Many students and parents ask questions about being expelled from midterm or final exams without paying the contract in full. In this article, we will consider the legal aspects of this issue.</p> <h4>Is it legal to exclude a student from exams?</h4> <p><strong>No, it is not legal.</strong> Failure to pay a contract cannot be the reason for not admitting a student to the final and midterm exams. According to the legislation, if a student does not pay the contract at all, he can be expelled from the studentship, but actions such as exclusion from intermediate or final exams, not including him in the class, and not evaluating him are illegal. Below are the deadlines:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>25% payment:</strong> Payment must be made by <strong>September 15</strong> for recommended student applicants, and by <strong>October 1</strong> for second and subsequent students, or by the deadline extended by OTM.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>50% payment:</strong> Minimum of contract fee half will be made by January 1st. 75% payment: Three-thirds of the payment must be made by April 1st. The deadlines for foreign citizens are determined by the Higher Education Institution.</p> </li> </ul> <h4>Illegal Actions</h4> <p>Actions such as exclusion from mid-term or final exams, exclusion from classes, and deliberate failure of subjects are considered illegal. The rights of students must be ensured, and all actions must be carried out within the framework of the law. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oqishga-kirgan-yoki-kirmaganini-hozirdan-bilsa-boladimi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p>
