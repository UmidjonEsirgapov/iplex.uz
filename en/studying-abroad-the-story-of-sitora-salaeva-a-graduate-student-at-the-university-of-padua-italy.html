                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Photo: from Sitora Salaeva's personal archive In addition, each faculty in turn provides a limited number of grants for foreign students, and the amount of the grant also varies depending on the faculty.</strong><br/><strong>How to apply The application process for admission is very easy.</strong><br/><strong>Subject Related: Education in Italy: how to apply to universities, get a visa and get a 7,000 euro annual scholarship Photo: from Sitora Salaeva's personal archive Living expenses In Italy, you can get two types of insurance: public and private.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>In an interview with Spot, she spoke in detail about why she chose Italy, the difficulties of studying, and her internship in America.</p> <p><img class="lazy postCover" data-loaded="true" data-src="/media/img/2023/03/m4thHs16800072672462_l.jpg" src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/03/m4thHs16800072672462_l.jpg"/>Photo: from Sitora Salaeva's personal archive</p> <p>Sitora Salaeva Born in Tashkent. She received her bachelor's degree in "Electronic commerce" from the Tashkent University of Information Technologies, and her master's degree in the "Faculty of Computer Engineering" of this university.</p> <p>In 2019, she completed an internship in the USA within the framework of the "TechWomen" program.</p> <p>In 2020, she won the Italian "Padua International Excellence Scholarship".</p> <p>Now she is studying at the University of Padua for her second master's degree. He is studying cyber security.</p> <h3>Why Italy</h3> <p>I have always dreamed of traveling to Italy and studying there.</p> <p>That is why I started looking for opportunities to study in this country in the first place. I didn't even think about the grant when I applied.</p> <p>Another reason why I chose Italy is the affordability of education compared to other European countries or America.</p> <blockquote> <p>Also, I focused on the quality of education and the presence of a master's program in the field I want to study.</p> </blockquote> <p>2020 When I applied to Italy for a master's degree in cyber security, I only found the program I needed at the University of Padua.</p> <p></p> <p>Fortunately, the program was in English. In the same year, admission to the "Cyber Security" course was announced for the first time, and the process of accepting the first students began.</p> <p>So I managed to submit my documents at the last minute.</p> <h3>Advantages and disadvantages of the Italian education system</h3> <p>I think that studying in Italy has more positive aspects than negative aspects.</p> <p>First of all, getting a higher education. that the price is cheap. If a low-income family or their average annual income is less than the specified amount, a large discount on the tuition fee is provided or the opportunity to study completely free of charge.</p> <p>Secondly, the quality of education. The university provides education based on international and European standards.</p> <p>Study programs are always updated according to the requirements of the times and all opportunities are created for students to successfully start their careers.</p> <blockquote> <p>Thirdly, it is easy to enter some Italian universities. If you submit all the documents correctly and meet the minimum requirements, you can be admitted.</p> </blockquote> <p><img class="fr-fic fr-dii lazy" data-loaded="true" data-src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/03/dwcV8d16800072343404_b.jpg" src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/03/dwcV8d16800072343404_b.jpg"/></p> <p>Photo: from the personal archive of Sitora Salaeva</p> <p>Fourth, the philosophy of academic freedom. Here, the student decides what subjects to study, when to take which exams, and even when to graduate from the university.</p> <p></p> <p>Everything is given to the student himself. The most important thing is that you can take the exams several times.</p> <p>If you are not satisfied with the exam grade, you can take the same exam within the appropriate time frame until you get the grade you want.</p> <p>Fifth, you can continue your studies in the country you want under Erasmus or other similar international programs. is also given. Or it is possible to do an internship in other European countries under "Erasmus+". This program also includes a monthly stipend.</p> <p>I can say that studying here has a difficulty, not a negative side. That is, one of the difficulties is the bureaucracy.</p> <p>When you first come, it may seem incomprehensible and difficult, but after time you will begin to understand the reasons for this bureaucracy.</p> <blockquote> <p>It is easy to study, but it is very difficult to study. Often, students do not finish university on time.</p> </blockquote> <p>For example, a two-year master's degree can be completed in 3-3.5 years instead of 2 years, and no one will tell you anything about it.</p> <p>Here, those who graduate on time are considered geniuses. Because graduating is a great happiness and pride.</p> <p></p> <p>With academic freedom and the opportunity to take exams many times, it is not easy to pass the exams even with a minimum score.</p> <p>If you do not understand the subject well, it is very difficult to pass the exam and it is very easy to fail.</p> <h3>Top 3 universities</h3> <p>The university I am studying It is located in the beautiful Italian city of Padua.</p> <p>This city has been a student city for 800 years. A very safe, comfortable city to study and live in.</p> <p>In 1222, a group of students and professors from the University of Bologna left the university in search of academic freedom and founded the University of Padua.</p> <blockquote> <p>The first subjects taught were law and theology. The motto of the university is "Universa universis patavina libertas" which means "The freedom of Padua is universal for all".</p> </blockquote> <p>Padua is one of the second oldest universities in Italy and the fifth in the world.</p> <p>It is among the top 250 universities in the world according to "QS World Ranking".</p> <p>It is also one of the Top 3 best universities in Italy.</p> <h3>Internship in America</h3> <p>In 2019, I won a full scholarship to train in the USA under the TechWomen program.</p> <p></p> <p>I heard about the program from the girls who participated in it. This program was organized by the US Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and aims to support women and girls who are leaders in STEM fields. src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/03/ET220c16800072060354_b.jpg"/&gt;</p> <p>Photo: from Sitora Salaeva's personal archive</p> <p>The "TechWomen" program covers travel expenses and living expenses in America for five weeks.</p> <p>The program lasts 5 weeks in San Francisco and Washington DC, USA. </p> <p>During the program, I had the opportunity to meet Silicon Valley experts, talk about their experience, working conditions and get their advice.</p> <blockquote> <p>For example, I had the opportunity to participate in a meeting with experts from companies such as "Google", "Visa", "Autodesk", "Twitch".</p> </blockquote> <p>Also, In the TechWomen program, I had the opportunity to train at Wells Fargo, one of the largest banks in America.</p> <p>There I worked with the R&amp;D (research and development) group, which is engaged in the production of projects to improve banking services through innovative ideas.</p> <p></p> <p>I participated in their project "customer identity management".</p> <p>During the program, not only skills education, participation in trainings, but also various events and small trips on American culture are organized.</p> <h3>University grants and requirements</h3> <p>University of Padua provides various grants for foreign students based on their academic, professional achievements or family financial situation.</p> <p>"Regione Veneto" scholarships is a grant program of the Veneto region.</p> <p>The purpose of this grant is to provide financial support for undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students. is to provide equal conditions for education, regardless of their abilities.</p> <p>The grant is given to every student whose family income is below the specified amount, and the amount varies depending on the family's income and other conditions.</p> <p>For example, up to 7,000 euros are provided for foreign students per year.</p> <blockquote> <p>The grant includes tuition fees, accommodation, free meals in university canteens or </p> </blockquote> <p>In order to receive this scholarship, it is necessary to submit necessary documents about the family's financial situation and property.</p> <p></p> <p><img class="fr-fic fr-dii lazy" data-loaded="true" data-src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/03/PgXqqM16800070286747_b.jpg" src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/03/PgXqqM16800070286747_b.jpg"/></p> <p>Photo: from personal archive of Sitora Salaeva</p> <p>In addition, each faculty in turn provides a limited number of grants for foreign students, and the amount of the grant also varies depending on the faculty.</p> <p>For example, there are only two grants for the program "Cybersecurity" that I am studying, and its amount is 5530 euros for each academic year.</p> <p>There is another grant for foreign students - Padua International Excellence Scholarship. The amount of the scholarship is 8,000 euros per year and covers the cost of study.</p> <p>This grant allocates 53 places to English-taught courses at the bachelor's or master's level only.</p> <p>Candidates for both grants are selected on a competitive basis. This will take into account their high academic performance at the previous stage of study, compliance with the requirements of the recommended field of study and the academic quality they have received.</p> <h3>How to apply</h3> <p>The application process for admission is very easy.</p> <p></p> <p>For the master's degree, you must submit a notarized bachelor's degree, resume, motivation letter and IELTS certificate.</p> <blockquote> <p>Application periods for Italian universities vary. You can apply for two types of programs at the university: with limited and unlimited places.</p> </blockquote> <p>For programs with unlimited places, admission is throughout the year and according to the deadlines.</p> <p>For programs with limited places, the admission period is from January 7 to March 7.</p> <p>I think that admitted students should have a basic knowledge of the Italian language in order to use it in everyday life.</p> <p>University admission offers a free beginner's Italian language course for students.</p> <h3>Visa process</h3> <p>The student visa process is different from other visa types. After receiving the letter of admission from the university, you should apply for a visa to the Italian embassy in Tashkent.</p> <p>Required documents for the embassy:</p> <ul> <li>identity document;</li> <li>documents of education;</li> <li>documents confirming financial status;</li> <li>insurance.</li> <li>air ticket booking information;</li> <li>1 picture;</li> <li>Information about where to stay after going to Italy</li> <li>university acceptance letter;</li> <li>English language certificate;</li> <li>information from the workplace.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p><strong>Related to the topic:</strong> Education in Italy: how to apply to universities, get a visa and 7000 euros per year how to get a scholarship</p> </blockquote> <h3><img class="fr-fic fr-dii lazy" data-loaded="true" data-src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/03/UkGTRn16800072408960_b.jpg" src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/03/UkGTRn16800072408960_b.jpg"/></h3> <p>Photo: from Sitora Salaeva's personal archive</p> <h3>Living expenses</h3> <p>In Italy, you can get two types of insurance: public and private.</p> <p></p> <p>Private health insurance costs It depends on the insurance company and its rates.</p> <p>But it is better to get national health insurance for a student, for which you need to pay around 150 euros per year.</p> <p>The cost of living depends on the location and conditions of the apartment.</p> <p>Rental prices start from 270-300 euros on average. On average, it costs 100-150 euros for food and other expenses, and it depends on each person.</p> <p>In Italy, students are allowed to work 20 hours a week. Wages vary by region and industry, and the average hourly wage is around 7 euros. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/9/9-sinf-konstitutsiyaviy-huquq-asoslari" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
