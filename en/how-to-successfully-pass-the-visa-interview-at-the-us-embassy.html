                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was this:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>But I know that among those who went to America from Uzbekistan with visas, the number of those who overstayed is much larger. turned a large part of the population into labor migrants, and there are many of them among those coming to the USA.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Uzbekistan journalists asked Daniel Rosenblum, the ambassador of the USA to Uzbekistan, "why are most of the Uzbeks who want to go to the USA not granted visas?" asked.</p> <p>Actually, according to statistics, about 70% of Uzbeks who apply for a visa are rejected. This is the <strong>highest rate</strong> among the former Soviet countries.</p> <p>The ambassador answered this question as follows:</p> <p>"I do not directly interfere in the process of issuing visas, a special person who deals with it There is a department. But I know that among those who go to America with a visa, the number of people who stay longer than the specified period is much higher. Therefore, we carefully check each applicant." That is why they have restricted visa issuance to them, Behzod Mamadiyev writes.</p> <p>Indeed, there is soul in these words. Among those who came for study or tourism, there are many who stay here and work, earn money, and even live illegally. In fact, a tourist visa does not give the right to work in the United States.</p> <p>Economic difficulties in Uzbekistan have turned a large part of the population into migrant workers, and there are also many of them among those coming to the United States. Therefore, the USA has made it more difficult to issue a visa. As a result of this, the applications of those who want to come to the USA with a legitimate reason, that is, to study or as a tourist, are often rejected. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer to this question. Since the information given by the ambassador above is correct, the consul considers every applicant interviewed as a potential immigrant, that is, a person who will stay permanently in the United States. It is your responsibility to prove that you are actually going to study or travel and not to stay or earn money. If you can't convince them of this, you will automatically be rejected.</p> <p>Of course, these words are not information that will help you get a visa, but just an explanation of why the visa is being refused.</p> <p>What advice can I give to the interviewers?</p> <p><strong>Be sincere, don't lie.</strong> Don't be excited, don't be nervous. Don't smile, don't frown. If possible, joke with the consul. Feel free. Let the consul have sympathy and a positive opinion about you.</p> <p>The consul spends only <strong>2-3 minutes</strong> on each interlocutor. They may be tasked with rejecting 60-70 percent of applicants who come in every day. Make an impression that you will be included in the 20-30% of people who will be granted a visa.</p> <p>Of course, this only works if all your other documents are in place. So, prepare all the necessary documents and follow the above tips. That's all. It depends on luck.</p> <p>In practice, actually getting a visa often depends on luck or the mood of the consul. Good luck!</p> <p>Let me know if you come to the US. See you. 😉 — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/talim-shaklini-ozgartirish-tartibi-haqida-batafsil-tushuntirish" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources.
