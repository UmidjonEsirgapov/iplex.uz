                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>This rule is aimed at ensuring the equality of all students at school and preserving their individuality.</strong><br/><strong>Equality of talent In Japanese schools, one student is not allowed to stand out because of his talent.</strong><br/><strong>"Without talent" the concept of "no student" is a priority in the Japanese education system.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>The Japanese education system is one of the most orderly and strict systems in the world. The uniqueness and strict rules of this system are aimed at developing not only academic knowledge of Japanese students, but also personal discipline and respect for society. Below is detailed information about interesting rules in Japanese schools.</p> <h4>1. Romantic relationships are not allowed</h4> <p>Romantic relationships between students are strictly prohibited in Japanese schools. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that students can fully focus on their studies and tasks.</p> <h4>2. Access to the school canteen is prohibited</h4> <p>Students do not use the school canteen. Instead, government-prepared meals are brought into classrooms and students are forced to eat them. This rule focuses on children's healthy eating and prevents food waste.</p> <h4>3. No summer vacation</h4> <p>There is no concept of summer vacation in Japanese schools. Pupils go on a five-week vacation during the academic year, and teachers actively work with them during this period. This rule has been introduced so that students do not drift away from the educational process.</p> <h4>4. No janitors</h4> <p>Japanese schools do not have janitors. Students are responsible for cleaning and tidying up the school. This rule forms cleanliness and discipline in children and encourages them not to throw away excessive waste.</p> <h4>5. No hairstyles and varnishes are allowed</h4> <p>Students are not allowed to use various hairstyles and cosmetics. This rule aims to ensure the equality of all students in the school and preserve their individuality.</p> <h4>6. Wearing uniforms</h4> <p>Japanese children start wearing school uniforms after elementary school. The purpose of the uniform rule is to create order and a uniform appearance, which helps students focus on reading.</p> <h4>7. Swimming is mandatory</h4> <p>In Japanese schools, every student must know how to swim. Schools have swimming pools where all students are given swimming lessons. This rule promotes their physical development and teaches them the skills needed to ensure safety.</p> <h4>8. Equality of talent</h4> <p>In Japanese schools, one student is not allowed to stand out because of his talent. The concept of "no gifted student" is a priority in the Japanese education system. By ensuring that every student is considered equal and unique, the system aims to develop all students from all sides. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/talabalar-yotoqxonasiga-pul-tolashda-kimlarga-imtiyoz-berilishi-mumkin" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
