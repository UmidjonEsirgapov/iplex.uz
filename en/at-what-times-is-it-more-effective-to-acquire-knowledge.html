                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Of course, I highlighted the necessary areas: The level of knowledge acquisition during the day. Human physical characteristics are also important for the educational process. It doesn't change until 19:00.</strong><br/><strong>– Some people have a high level of activity again after 20:00 and it is maintained until 22:00.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Of course, I marked the necessary places in <strong>bold</strong>:</p> <p><strong>The level of knowledge acquisition during the day</strong></p> <p>The person <strong>physical characteristics</strong> are also important for the educational process. In schools, taking into account the <strong>physical condition</strong> of children related to mastering the subjects according to the difficulty of the subjects increases the effectiveness of the lessons.</p> <p>The <strong>activity</strong> of the human body undergoes unique changes around the clock, that is, during 24 hours. Sometimes they focus on performance and refreshment, and other times on <strong>sleep and rest</strong>. These <strong>biological clocks</strong> can be different for each person. It is natural that someone is a "day person" and someone is a "night person". However, there are <strong>levels of activity</strong> that are common to most people.</p> <p>According to research:</p> <p>– <strong>After 7:00</strong> in the morning, a person’s ability to work increases. <strong>optimal work ability</strong> is observed.</p> <p>– <strong>Around 12:00-13:00</strong>, the ability <strong>decreases</strong>.</p> <p>– <strong>at 2:00-3:00</strong> it goes to the lowest level – <strong>clearly expressed</strong> external signs of fatigue are visible (for example, slowing down work, not noticing mistakes, yawning, etc.).</p> <p>– <strong>After 3:00 p.m.</strong> the ability increases a little, but does not return until <strong>noon</strong> and in this case <strong>from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.</strong> does not change.</p> <p>– Some <strong>after 8:00 p.m.</strong> again It will have a <strong>high activity level</strong> and will last until 10:00 p.m. But such people are rare. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/milliy-sertifikat-dars-taqsimotida-ustunlik-beradimi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources.
