But for Professor Lee, it's a natural part of healthy child development. During his 30 years of research, he has delved into how children lie, leading to a number of innovations, from changes in child witness laws to improvements in child behavioral diagnostics.</p> <p>In his research, Kang Lee found that children can lie at a very young age. For example, he and his team tested children through a card game and found that 30 percent of 2-year-olds, 50 percent of 3-year-olds, and more than 80 percent of 4-year-olds lied. This experiment showed that lying at an early age is a sign of a child's developing cognitive abilities.</p> <p>Professor Lee made another important discovery: even when children know that lying is wrong, this does not affect their ability to refrain from lying. This discovery prompted a review of Canadian legislation. In 2006, the requirement that children prove they know it is morally wrong to lie before testifying was dropped, replacing it with a promise to tell the truth. He found that their main problem was not in moral concepts, but in emotional control. Therefore, he suggests teaching children skills to help them curb negative behaviors.</p> <p>In his further research, Professor Lee invented a lie detector technology called transdermal optical imaging. This technology monitors changes in blood circulation on a person's face and provides information about health conditions. This is now the basis of an artificial intelligence system called DeepAffex, with approximately 20 million users using the technology to monitor heart rate, blood pressure and other health indicators.</p> <p>Kang Li is currently working on expanding the technology to measure mental health. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/abituriyentlarga-5tagacha-bakalavriat-talim-yonalishi-boyicha-tanlovda-ishtirok-etish-huquqi-beriladi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>Stay tuned for more news in education.
