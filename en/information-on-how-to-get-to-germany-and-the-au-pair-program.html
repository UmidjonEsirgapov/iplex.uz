                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>That is, you cannot work or study during the Au pair program.</strong><br/><strong>I think the Au pair program is a very useful program.</strong><br/><strong>Zilolakhan Ikromova is currently helping many young people to learn German and to go to Germany. are coming.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Today we will talk about easy ways to get to Germany. Our hero, Zilolakhan Ikromova, will provide complete and necessary information about going to Germany and the Au Pair program.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Please tell us a little about yourself. I am Ikramova Zilolakhan. During the years 2018/2019, I returned to Stuttgart, Germany, as an au pair participant. I started learning German in November 2017, and 5-6 months later I signed a contract with a German host family and flew to Germany in September 2018. During <strong>1 year</strong> in Germany, I managed to raise my language level to <strong>B2 level</strong> (it was A2 level before I left). I am currently organizing <strong>online courses</strong> in German. Several of my students were able to go to Germany through Au pair/FSJ programs. Others have obtained language certificates. <ul> <li><strong>What are the ways to go to Germany and what are the advantages of the Aupair program?</strong></li> </ul> <p><em>There are several easy and popular ways to go to Germany. </em><em>We can include: Aupair program, FSJ or BFD, Ausbildung and various Sommerkurs/Sprachkurs. The </em><strong><em>cheapest and easiest way</em></strong><em> is the Au pair program, because you don't need a lot of money and your language level doesn't have to be perfect. The embassy also issues visas quickly.</em></p> <ul> <li><strong>Who can apply for the au pair program, what do they need to do to apply, what are the requirements?</strong></li> </ul> <p><em>The au pair program is a program through which young people can go to another country and learn the language, culture and territory of that country with a host family. In return, he will have to look after the children of the host family for 6 hours, 5 days a week, that is, for a total of 30 hours. The language level should be <strong>not less than A1</strong> (the higher the better). The program usually lasts from 6 months to 1 year. During this time, the au pair lives with the host family as if it were a member of the family. Duties of an au pair can include:</em></p> <ul> <li><em>Looking after children;</em></li> <li><em>Dropping and bringing children to school or kindergarten;</em></li> <li><em>Playing with children;</em></li> <li><em>Preparing breakfast, helping with some household chores, etc.</em></li> </ul> <p><em>Tasks are distributed based on the situation of the host family. In return, the host family must provide the Au pair with a separate room, i.e. accommodation, food, create conditions for language learning and pay 50 euros for the course, a monthly pocket money of 260 euros and cover other expenses (insurance and travel to/from the course). At the same time, the family will show you their culture and take you on trips with them. (You don't have to go on trips, but I always recommend going). In this case, the family covers all expenses.</em></p> <ul> <li><strong>Is it possible to work or study during the Aupair program? </strong></li> </ul> <p><em>The Au pair program only gives you the opportunity to live and learn a language with that host family. That is, you cannot work or study during the Au pair program. Au pair visa is intended only for this program. If you intend to study, you can start after the end of the Au pair program and you will be issued a separate study visa.</em></p> <ul> <li><strong>Everyone talks about the Au pair program differently. As an experienced person, would you recommend this program to Uzbek girls? Please tell us a little about the Host Families. </strong></li> </ul> <p><em>I think the au pair program is a very useful program. Because you can learn a language and see the world without spending a lot of money. This is a great opportunity. As for German families, they welcome au pairs very warmly, and there are even families who treat au pairs as part of their own family and keep in touch even after the contract ends. (For example, most of the former au pairs of the host family I went to stayed in Germany to work or study and came to see the family every 3 or 4 months or during the holidays, even though their contracts were over 3 or 4 years old). Of course, this program is very suitable for Uzbek girls, because 1 family will be responsible for you for 1 year, if you are sick, they will pay for treatment, and you can get help in other matters. I think it is a better choice to come to a foreign country through an Au pair and start studying after learning the conditions than to come to a foreign country.</em></p> <ul> <li><strong>What should be considered when going to Germany? What problems or challenges have you encountered? Your advice and suggestions for young people.</strong></li> </ul> <p><em>First of all, it is important to raise your German language level to a good level. A1 level is enough, if you go with at least A2 or B1, you will not have difficulty there and you will save yourself from many misunderstandings. Basically I didn't have too many difficulties because I was guided by someone who had been to the Au pair program and had experience. It is also very helpful to get help and advice from someone with such experience. Other than that, I only tried to communicate in German. I was able to speak and express my thoughts in German both in the conversation with my family and in the embassy. That's why I wasn't asked for a language certificate to prove my language level (they often ask for a language certificate). In the following places, clearly define your destination before you leave. If you intend to study or stay in another program after the Au pair program, or if it is just a language or travel, you can make the most of the one year opportunity given to you. Zilolakhan Ikromova is now teaching German language to many young people and helping them to go to Germany. In particular, through https://t.me/oson_nemistili (<strong>Channel:</strong> @oson_nemistili <strong>Gruppe:</strong> @o_n_Gruppe <strong>Admin:</strong> @German_tutor) they have been teaching German language to young people. In addition, our Hero has also organized online courses, and in these courses, they teach the easiest ways to learn German based on their experience. You can find information about courses through the channel and learn German from Zilolakhan Ikromova, who lived in Germany for 1 year. We wish Zilolakhan good luck in his future endeavors!</em></p> <p> </p> <p>  — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qarshi-nukus-qoqon-va-toshkentdagi-universitetlarga-rahbarlar-almashtirildi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education..</strong></li></ul>
