                Today's most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Photo: From Malika Tursunova's personal archive Visa process Getting a visa to France as a student is not a difficult process.</strong><br/><strong>Living expenses There are many discounts for students in France.</strong><br/><strong>For example, if I want to visit museums in France, I don't have to pay for it.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>In an interview with Spot, he talked about why he chose France, discounts for students in the country and the process of applying for a grant.</p> <p><img class="lazy postCover" data-loaded="true" data-src="/media/img/2023/04/AF1Uiw16806088769662_l.jpg" src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/04/AF1Uiw16806088769662_l.jpg"/>Photo: from Malika Tursunova's personal archive</p> <p>Malika Tursunova graduated from the academic lyceum of the international Westminster University in Tashkent.</p> <p>Currently, she is studying economics at the University of Strasbourg in France.</p> <p>She won a 100% grant from the Islamic Development Bank and the "Campus France" organization under the French Embassy.</p> <p></p> <p>Malika told "Spot" why she chose France, the process of applying for a grant and discounts for students in the country.</p> <h3>Why France</h3> <p>I first heard about studying abroad at the international Westminster in Tashkent. I started thinking when I was studying at the academic lyceum of the university.</p> <blockquote> <p>The reason for this was the atmosphere in the lyceum. Many people were studying abroad there, and slowly I started to have the same desire.</p> </blockquote> <p>I really wanted to study in England, but the universities there are very expensive and it was difficult to get a bigger grant. I started studying.</p> <h3>Application processes</h3> <p>Higher education in France (as well as some other European countries) is almost free - you only need to pay 170 euros a year for a bachelor's degree.</p> <p></p> <p>The application process for a bachelor's degree lasts from early autumn to December, and for a master's degree from January to February.</p> <blockquote> <p>You can apply to French universities in Uzbekistan through the "Campus France" organization under the country's embassy.</p> </blockquote> <p><img class="fr-fic fr-dii lazy" data-loaded="true" data-src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/04/2Hj1ve16806089702324_b.jpg" src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/04/2Hj1ve16806089702324_b.jpg"/></p> <p>Photo: from the personal archive of Malika Tursunova</p> <p>You give them the necessary documents and fill out the "Dossier Blanc" application, which asks you to choose the direction you want to study and 3 universities.</p> <p>After that, "Campus France" will send these documents to the universities itself.</p> <p>The documents must be delivered to the "Campus France" organization in person, that is, there is no possibility to submit them online.</p> <p>The following documents are requested to be submitted to the universities:</p> <ul> <li>motivational letter;</li> <li>CV/Resume;</li> <li>school grades. transcripts;</li> <li>certificate;</li> <li>certificate of language proficiency;</li> <li>recommendation letters (for master's degree).</li> </ul> <p>As for language, whether or not knowledge of French is mandatory depends on the program you are applying to.</p> <p></p> <p>If you are applying to a program taught in English, knowledge of French is not mandatory.</p> <p>Each Based on their requirements, the university may request TCF, DELF/DALF for French language programs, and IELTS or TOEFL certificates for English language programs.</p> <p>In addition, the submitted documents must be translated into the language you choose to study.</p> <h3>100% grant program</h3> <blockquote> <p>The grant I received is a joint grant from the Islamic Development Bank and Campus France. grant.</p> </blockquote> <p>This grant covers almost all expenses. In particular, tuition and visa costs are covered and a monthly stipend of <strong>€700</strong> is provided.</p> <p>If you live outside the university dormitories, in a rented house and you are not older than 26, the French government will give you additional funds.</p> <p>For example, I pay €550 a month for rent, so €230 is given to me by the French government just because I am a student and outside the university. he gives it because I live in a rental.</p> <p>By the way, no financial documents are required to use this privilege, and it is not necessary to be a French citizen.</p> <p><img class="fr-fic fr-dii lazy" data-loaded="true" data-src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/04/PvjxGE16806089762704_b.jpg" src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/04/PvjxGE16806089762704_b.jpg"/></p> <p> You submit to the embassy in Uzbekistan:</p> <ul> <li>application;</li> <li>a letter of acceptance to the university;</li> <li>a document reflecting the financial situation (parental income or bank account);</li> <li>a document confirming the payment of the visa fee;</li> <li>medical insurance;</li> <li>passport/ID;</li> <li>proof of your place of residence in France document;</li> <li>Air tickets to fly to France (not always required).</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>If all the documents you submit are reliable and the embassy believes that your financial situation is sufficient, you will most likely get a visa.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was very easy for me to get a visa because I won a full grant.</p> <h3>Living expenses</h3> <p>There are many discounts for students in France. This allows students to save more money.</p> <p>For example, I spend 150-250 euros per month on groceries and 320 euros per month on rent because the French government covers half of my rent.</p> <p>These are my main monthly expenses.</p> <p><strong>Working as a student.</strong> International students in France legally work 20 hours a week. It's possible.</p> <p></p> <p>It's about 10 euros an hour here, but after taxes it can be as low as 8 euros.</p> <p>I'm not working anywhere because the grant I got covers all my expenses, so I'm focusing on studying.</p> <h3>Pros and cons of studying in France</h3> <p>Other cons than being away from home almost none.</p> <blockquote> <p>One thing I didn't really like was that I couldn't completely choose the subjects to take.</p> </blockquote> <p><img class="fr-fic fr-dii lazy" data-loaded="true" data-src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/04/DwQKDI16806089631093_b.jpg" src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/04/DwQKDI16806089631093_b.jpg"/></p> <p>Photo: from Malika Tursunova's personal archive</p> <p>For example, last year I had to study subjects such as law and history, even though my field is economics.</p> <p>As for the positive aspects, they are many. First of all, I should mention quality education.</p> <p>Many professors at our university have supported doctoral dissertations. They conduct various researches, participate in high-level conferences, and students have the opportunity to get quality knowledge from them.</p> <p></p> <p>The most important thing is that students do not have to spend much on themselves to use these opportunities.</p> <p>Another good thing is that, as I said earlier, there are always <strong>discounts</strong> for students in France.</p> <p>For example, in university canteens for a very low price, i.e. 1 you can eat for a euro. This 1 euro includes a salad, main course and dessert.</p> <blockquote> <p>There is also a 70% discount on medical services and you do not need to pay for permanent health insurance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some services are even free. For example, if I want to go to museums in France, I don't have to pay for it.</p> <p>And one of the most important and good things here is great career opportunities.</p> <p>Because there are many famous brands and companies in France, and studying here will give you an advantage when applying for a job in these companies. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/matematika-fanidan-milliy-sertifikat-imtihoni-spetsifikatsiyasi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p>
