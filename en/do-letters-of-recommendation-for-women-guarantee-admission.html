                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Applicants also receive a letter of recommendation from the State Committee for Family and Women.</strong><br/><strong>This letter of recommendation is also valid for 3 years.</strong><br/><strong>In addition to general applicants, their scores are considered separately for those with a letter of recommendation, and those with the highest scores are given preferential treatment. will be accepted as a student, and those who do not get enough points will participate in the general competition like other applicants and may or may not be able to become a student depending on their score.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>2 types of recommendations are given to women by the Family and Women's Committee. An applicant with this letter of recommendation will be accepted as a student outside of the specified quota.</p> <p><strong>500 quota for those with 5 years of experience</strong></p> <p>The Family and Women's Committee has started issuing letters of recommendation to women with 5 years of experience and no higher education. The deadline for submitting an application for a recommendation is June 1. Applications are submitted to working groups organized in district and city departments of the committee.</p> <p>Applicant to receive a recommendation must meet the following requirements:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>have a specialty in secondary special or professional education;</li> <li>not have received or will not receive a higher education before receiving a recommendation;</li> <li>secondary special or professional education must have at least five years of work experience in the specialty.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p><strong>Required documents:</strong></p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Citizen's passport or ID card copy;</li> <li>Extract from the work record (electronic work record);</li> <li>Diploma of secondary special or professional education.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Applications will be reviewed and handed over to the owners by June 15. The term of validity of the recommendation is 3 years. Those who received a letter of recommendation last year, but did not become a student, can use the same letter of recommendation this year.</p> <p>The letter of recommendation alone does not guarantee admission. Women who have received it will take the exam like all other applicants, only their score will be calculated within a special quota. 500 applicants with the highest scores will be accepted on the basis of a student fee-contract.</p> <p><strong>2 thousand grants</strong></p> <p>One of the main opportunities for women to study is a grant of 4 percent of the total quota allocated to women from needy families (2 thousand places). Applicants also receive a letter of recommendation from the State Committee for Family and Women. In the last 2022 admission, applications for letters of recommendation were received from May 30 to June 8. This year, the issuance of letters of recommendation has not yet started.</p> <p><strong>Who can receive a letter of recommendation?</strong></p> <p>Candidates who meet the following requirements can receive a letter of recommendation for a quota of 2,000:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Women from low-income families (the minimum wage for each member of the family during the period when the total income is determined) A family with a monthly average total income of no more than 0.527 times);</li> <li>Girls in need of social protection who are brought up in a single-parent family, that is, in need of social protection, whose father or mother or both of them have died;</li> <li>Women in need of social protection, whose spouse has died, who are raising their minor child alone;</li> <li>Disabled child women in needy families;</li> <li>daughters of single women who are raising two or more children under the age of 14, living separately (on rent) from other relatives, in need of social protection;</li> <li>women in needy families with one or both parents having first or second group disabilities.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>The validity period of this recommendation is also 3 year. For example, an applicant who received a letter of recommendation last year, but was not admitted, can use it this year as well and participate in an out-of-quota competition. Their scores are considered separately for those with recommendations, in addition to general applicants, and those with the highest scores are admitted as students with preferential treatment, while those who do not score enough take part in the general competition like other applicants and may or may not become students depending on their score.</p> <p><strong>How was the competition last year?</strong></p> <p>Last year, 1.9 thousand people from needy families women, and 379 women with at least 5 years of work experience were recommended to students. According to the information received from the Agency for the Evaluation of Knowledge and Skills, the unfilled quotas are due to the fact that there were no applicants who could score the required points in some regions when the quotas were distributed by directions and regions. an applicant who has scored, but is in the first place in his field, will not be accepted as a student. To become a student, you need to score at least 30% of the maximum score. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/it-girls-2023-dasturiga-arizalar-qabul-qilinmoqda" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <blockquote>Note: if you have letters of recommendation from previous years, you do not need to do anything when applying.
