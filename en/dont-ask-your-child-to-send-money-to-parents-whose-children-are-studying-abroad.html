                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Uzbek scientist in Japan Alisher Umirdinov's address to Uzbek parents: ❌ Dear parents, if you have sent your child to study abroad, until they get a bigger scholarship or, if not, until they graduate and get a job. don't ask your child to send money.</strong><br/><strong>After all, they went to study!</strong><br/><strong>Not to work!</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Appeal of Uzbek scientist Alisher Umirdinov in Japan to Uzbek parents: </p> <p>❌ Dear parents, if you sent your child to study abroad, they will get a bigger scholarship. Don't ask your child to send money until he or she has completed his or her studies and is employed. Don't just demand, don't expect. Your children studying abroad are not the hen that lays the golden egg.</p> <p>The vast majority of them earn contract sums, and at the same time, they need to work for a living. After all, as a student, they should have fun!</p> <p>Many parents and family members do not understand this - they expect money from them, buy houses, cars, and weddings. Even if the money sent this month is a little less than last month, "boy, is it a little less this time?" They don't even like to give him a joke.</p> <p>Ignorant parents and brothers want to send him away when they see the attitude of the student who went on a journey in the pursuit of knowledge. After all, they went to study! Not for hard work!</p> <p>❕According to the scientist, those who are trying to earn money without paying attention to their studies will remain at the level of taxi drivers and salesmen even after 7-8 years. </p> <p>That is why: </p> <p>✔️ parents should wait until their children finish their studies;</p> <p>✔️ students should not rush to earn money. If you find a job in a good place after finishing your studies, you will see more benefit from it. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/germaniyada-oqish-uchun-helmut-shmidt-stipendiyasiga-arizalar-qabul-qilinmoqda" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
