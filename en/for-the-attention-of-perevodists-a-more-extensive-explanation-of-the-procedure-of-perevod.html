                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Procedure for transferring studies from abroad 📌 Basic requirements: A test or creative exam for a suitable and related course is submitted and a passing score must be collected. is required.</strong><br/><strong>🌐 Application submission addresses: transfer.edu.uz — for transfers from state HEIs to state HEIs or internal transfers; my.uzbmb.uz/service/41 — from a foreign/non-state HEI to a state HEI.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Attention of transferers: detailed instructions on the procedure of "transfer"</h2> <p>On the basis of <strong>Presidential Decree No. PQ-279</strong> of June 15, 2022, the procedure for transferring students' studies in Uzbekistan is established. Below are the main rules and requirements for all forms of transfer.</p> <h3>🏛 1. Transfer of studies from one country to another country's higher education institution</h3> <p>In this case, it is allowed only on the basis of <strong>two reasons</strong>:</p> <h4> ✅ Allowed reasons:</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Marriage</strong>: in the area where the student started a family and his spouse lives If he wants to move to the OTM.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Moving of the civil servant</strong>: if the civil servant moved to another region for work, his spouse or child can transfer his studies to the OTM in that region.</p> </li> </ul> <p>🔁 In other cases, even to transfer to <strong>another OTM in his province</strong> one of the reasons is required.</p> <h3>🌍 2. The procedure for transferring studies from abroad</h3> <h4>📌 Main requirements:</h4> <ul> <li> <p><strong>A test or a creative exam is submitted to a suitable and similar field</strong> and a passing score must be collected.</p> </li> <li> <p>If he fails to collect a passing score, based on the <strong>super-contract</strong> it is possible to transfer studies.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Transfers to unsuitable courses are <strong>prohibited</strong>.</strong></p> </li> </ul> <p>👉 The list of passing scores and courses for 2025 is published on the Khushnudbek.uz Telegram channel.</p> <h3>🏫 3. From foreign and non-state HEIs in Uzbekistan transfer</h3> <h4>📌 Requirements:</h4> <ul> <li> <p>An exam and a passing score are required for a suitable course.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the passing score is not enough, it is possible to transfer on the basis of a <strong>super-contract</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To study an unsuitable course on the basis of a <strong>one-time super-contract</strong> without an exam can be transferred.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>🔁 4.

Each non-state HEI follows its own internal rules in this regard.</p> <h3>🌐 6. Transfer from abroad to a non-state HEI</h3> <p>This procedure is also not controlled by the state. A student should get information about this from the non-state higher education institution he wants to transfer his studies to. The application is written in the name of the rector. The following are taken into account:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Compatibility of courses;</p> </li> <li> <p>Reasons for relocation;</p> </li> <li> <p>OET opportunities.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>🕰 8. Changing the form of education or teaching language</h3> <p>The <strong>OET administration</strong> will decide this issue. It is usually possible to switch from daytime to another mode, but it is almost <strong>impossible</strong> to switch from remote or evening mode to daytime.</p> <h2>📝 Application procedure and required documents</h2> <h3>📅 Application deadline:</h3> <p><strong>From July 15 to August 5 (also on this day).</strong></p> <h3>🌐 Application addresses:</h3> <ul> <li> <p>transfer.edu.uz — from state HEI to state HEI or for internal transfers;</p> </li> <li> <p>my.uzbmb.uz/service/41 — from foreign/non-government HEI to state HEI.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>📎 Required documents:</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Application (online);</p> </li> <li> <p>Transcript or rating notebook (JPEG/PDF);</p> </li> <li> <p>Academic reference (if resuming studies).</p> </li> </ul> <h2> ✅ Summary</h2> <p>The process of transferring studies (perevod) is strictly regulated. Transfer between state HEIs is allowed only under certain conditions. When transferring from abroad or non-state, there are test, passing score and super-contract bases. It is recommended to carefully study the official sources before any transfer. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oliygoh/toshkent-davlat-texnika-universiteti-olmaliq-filiali" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
