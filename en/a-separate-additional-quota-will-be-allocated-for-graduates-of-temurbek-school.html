                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Now graduates of the Temurbek school, if they can collect enough points for the passing score, a special additional quota will be allocated for them. an additional quota will be allocated.</strong><br/><strong>This change is an important step to make the process of admission to public higher education institutions more transparent and fair.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>According to the new decree signed by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, a special additional quota will be allocated for applicants with the privilege of being given extra points for admission to public higher education institutions. This benefit will be implemented in the academic year 2024/2025.</p> <p><strong>Why is this change important?</strong></p> <p>Now graduates of the School of Blacksmiths, if they can collect enough points for the passing score, a separate additional quota will be allocated for them. This means that an additional quota will be allocated on the basis of a state grant or payment contract for the graduates of the Temurbek school, if they score a predetermined passing score and above. The number of these quotas is not known in advance, because it is not clear in advance how many graduates will be able to enter. After the mandate, it will be clear how many grants or contracts will be allocated to the privileged.</p> <p><strong>How will it affect?</strong></p> <p>The most important thing is that the graduates of the Temurbek school will not interfere with others. This new system will make the admissions process fairer and reduce competition with other applicants.</p> <p>This change is an important step to make the admissions process in public higher education institutions more transparent and fair. The allocation of an additional quota for the graduates of the Temurbek school is aimed at valuing their knowledge and training and encouraging them more. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ona-tili-va-adabiyot-fanidan-milliy-sertifikat-imtihoni-bolimlari" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p>
