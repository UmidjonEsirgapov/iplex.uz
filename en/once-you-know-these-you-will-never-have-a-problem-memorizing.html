                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>There is a saying in our people: "Memorize a hundred times, seal a thousand times".</strong><br/><strong>This proverb is valid only when it is followed correctly. </strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong> In our people, there is a proverb that says, "A hundred times a memory, a thousand times a seal".</strong></p> <p>This proverb is valid only when it is followed correctly. Because, in order for the brain to seal the information, it should not be temporarily loaded with other information. </p> <p>Researchers Müller and Piltsecker note that after memorizing a text, the brain should rest. In the process of listening, the brain repeats information by itself. This process is also broken if the information is returned out of place after it has been memorized. As a result, no "sealing" process occurs in the brain. </p> <p><strong>So, how long should the brain rest between memorizing and consolidating information? Psychologist Peron answered this question. He conducted an experiment on several people, asking them to memorize and repeat 18 unfamiliar words.</strong></p> <p>In the experiment, the words were repeated 14 times after 30 seconds. And when the break was 10 minutes, it was enough to repeat 4 times. Information is consolidated in short-term memory during a break of 10 minutes to 24 hours. For breaks longer than 24 hours, the number of repetitions increases, and when reaching 48 hours, 8 repetitions are required. Because, during this time, the additional information stored in the memory reduces the memory capacity. </p> <p>That is why it is advisable to recall memorized words every 24 hours. The fact that many aspects of the text are similar to each other makes the process of memorization difficult. If the set of words is structured in different ways, it will be easier. For example, what comes to mind when you think of a word written in list order? </p> <p>Of course, its place on the list. This does not indicate the strength of the memory. It just means that there is nothing more important to remember that word. Therefore, each memorized word should stand out from others in its own way. If you avoid monotony when writing them, and use different colors or letter shapes, you can achieve positive results in the process of memorization. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/professional-dasturchi-bolish-uchun-qancha-vaqt-kerak" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.
