                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The start date of the tests is not determined by the State Testing Center, but by the decision of the State Commission for Admission to Educational Institutions of the Republic of Uzbekistan.</strong><br/><strong>As for online tests, no country in the world conducts online tests for such a large number of applicants, it is not possible. no.</strong><br/><strong>In this regard, the State Testing Center contacted all our international partners and it was said that none of them planned to conduct online tests.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Currently, information is spreading on social networks that it is not appropriate to conduct entrance tests for higher education institutions planned to be conducted by the State Testing Center in pandemic conditions. The State Testing Center issued an official statement on the same situation:</p> <p>Currently, the buildings where the tests are conducted are equipped with cooling and ventilation systems, and in order for the applicants to maintain social distance, a space of no less than 3 square meters is allocated to each applicant, and relevant conclusions are received from the Sanitary and Epidemiological Peace Agency regarding the condition of the buildings. All work on the implementation of the tests is carried out in accordance with the Sanitary and Epidemiological Security Agency and the Special Republican Commission, based on their recommendations. there is no evidence to say that when tests are conducted in other countries, the risk is less, and in ours it is more.</p> <p>We all know that it would be wrong to return to the system of organizing tests in schools. The "teachers" who want to "help" the applicants in some way, of course, find it very convenient to go back and are busy instilling this idea into the brains of young people by masking the pandemic situation in the world.</p> <p>As for online tests, no country in the world conducts online tests for such a large number of applicants, it is not possible. In this regard, the State Testing Center contacted all our international partners, and it was said that none of them have plans to conduct online tests.</p> <p>Even the organizations that use the "Online proctoring" system (taking tests at home and monitoring them online) have emphasized that its safety and the ways in which cheating can be done have not yet been fully studied. They also mentioned that there is no plan to abandon this system after the pandemic is over.</p> <p>Nowadays, we know very well that no one can say that he can completely protect himself from this infection.</p> <p>Therefore, we inform you that the tests planned by the State Testing Center will not only be fair and transparent, but also that the health of the applicants is the first priority, and we will ensure this as much as possible. we will try.</p> <p>  — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/2024-yilda-359-ming-ozbekiston-fuqarosi-oqish-maqsadida-chet-elga-ketgan" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
