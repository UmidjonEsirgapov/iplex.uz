                Useful information for entrants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>According to the analysis of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, the average cost of training without a scholarship in the fields of education is 13 million 640 thousand soums.</strong><br/><strong>The average payment contract value is 7 million 446 thousand soums, i.e. covers 54% of the expenses.</strong><br/><strong>It would be better if detailed information about what the annual tuition expenses are made of is announced - writes Khushnudbek Khudoiberdiyev.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>What are the average tuition expenses per student?</strong></p> <p>State higher education The analysis of the average full-time education costs per student and the state of reimbursement of undergraduate education for the academic year 2023/2024 was announced. You can read more information here.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>According to the analysis of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation</strong>, the cost of education without scholarships in the average educational fields is <strong>13 million 640 thousand soums</strong>. The average payment contract value is <strong>7 million 446 thousand soums</strong>, i.e. it covers <strong>54%</strong> of the expenses.</p> <p>In some areas, the amount of the contract does not even cover half of the annual expenses. For example, if the contract for an art student is <strong>7 million 771 thousand soums</strong> per year, the amount of expenses for him is <strong>28 million 759 thousand soums</strong> (27%). covers.</p> <p>In the list of areas where the contract amount covers most of the costs:</p> <ul> <li><strong>law</strong> (81.2%)</li> <li><strong>world economy and international relations</strong> (81.2%)</li> <li><strong>world politics</strong> (81.2%)</li> <li><strong>economy</strong> (75.6%)</li> <li><strong>information technology</strong> (75.6%)</li> </ul> <p>placed.</p> <p>There is no 100% covered route. But, if I'm not mistaken, the amount of the payment-contract at <strong>University of World Economy and Diplomacy</strong> was higher than 18 million soums, so it can be seen that more contracts are received compared to the expenses spent at this university.
