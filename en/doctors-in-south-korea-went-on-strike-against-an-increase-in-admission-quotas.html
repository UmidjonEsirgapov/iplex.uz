According to them, the increase in numbers will only increase the state's medical expenses. As in the current situation, even with more students studying, doctors will still find themselves in high-demand fields such as dermatology and plastic surgery, and there will be a shortage of specialists in low-paid fields such as pediatrics, obstetrics and emergency medicine. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/yaponiya-bakalavr-va-magistratura-talabalari-uchun-qiymati-taxminan-910-aqsh-dollari-miqdorida-oylik-stipendiya" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
