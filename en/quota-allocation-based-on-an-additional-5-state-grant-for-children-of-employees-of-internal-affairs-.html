                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>If in previous years these benefits were distributed among higher education institutions, this year the quota is distributed among organizations. </strong><br/><strong>No additional points will be given to applicants with a preferential quota.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>5% state grant quota for children of employees of internal affairs bodies (2024/2025)</h2> <p>Additional 5% state grant for children of employees working in the system of internal affairs bodies in the academic year 2024/2025 quota allocated. This discount is valid for the first chosen field of the applicants.</p> <h3>Total number of allocated quota</h3> <p>📌 <strong>Total quota:</strong> 1,775 (based on state grant only).</p> <h3>The discount is only valid for the first field</h3> <p>Although applicants have the right to choose five fields of study, this discount is only <strong>first choice</strong> – that is, applies to the first direction. If the applicant does not get into the preferential quota in this direction, he will compete equally with other applicants in the general quota based on his scores.</p> <h3>How will the quota be distributed?</h3> <p>If in previous years these privileges were distributed among higher education institutions, <strong>this year, the quota is distributed among organizations</strong>. This means:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The institution of higher education or the field is not important.</p> </li> <li> <p>All applicants who have received a recommendation from the internal affairs system will be included in the general list with their scores.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <strong>1,775 applicants with the highest scores</strong> will go to the field of their first choice based on the state grant. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Example: If 6,000 applicants receive a recommendation letter from the Internal Affairs system, 1,775 of them with a higher score will receive a grant. The rest will participate in the general competition with their points.</p> <h3>Will points be added?</h3> <p><strong>No.</strong> No <strong>additional points</strong> will be given to the applicants with preferential quota. They are selected on the basis of their scores in the DTM test.</p> <h3>Minimum score requirement for using the privilege</h3> <p>‼️ To use the preferential quota, the applicant must have scored at least <strong>68 points</strong>. Otherwise, the recommendation will be invalid and you will not be able to use this benefit.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The 5% state grant quota for the children of the employees of the internal affairs bodies is an important opportunity aimed at ensuring social justice. But there are clear criteria for using this opportunity: the applicant must score at least 68 points, choose the first course correctly and have a recommendation letter. This year, the selection will be more transparent and competitive as the quotas will be distributed across the organization. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/2024-yil-majburiy-tarix-fanidan-tushgan-savollar-va-javoblari" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.
