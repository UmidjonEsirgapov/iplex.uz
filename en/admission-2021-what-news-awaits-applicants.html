                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>This year the questions will not be as easy as last year The number of logical questions will be increased in the entrance exams.</strong><br/><strong>So, before this year entrance exams, get a certificate in 5 subjects: Mathematics, Mother Tongue, Chemistry, Biology and English and get a score in advance It is possible.</strong><br/><strong>For example, last year due to the pandemic, the number of applicants who scored maximum points due to the simplification of questions was close to a thousand. The head of the DTM department answered the questions of the applicants.</strong> <p><strong>It is planned to take exams in 5 subjects this year</strong></p> <p>This year the entrance exams will be held in 5 subjects. According to the presidential decree, the entrance exams will be held in 2 specialties and 3 compulsory subjects. Compulsory subjects include mother tongue, mathematics and the history of Uzbekistan.</p> <p>Last year, taking into account the conditions of the pandemic, the exams were exceptionally reduced to 2 subjects.</p> <p><strong>The possibility of choice may not be limited</strong></p> <p>DTM made a proposal to allow applicants to choose any educational direction in the entrance exams to higher organizations. If the offer is accepted, the applicants will be able to choose 20 or 25 courses suitable for their subjects, instead of 5 courses as in the previous year. If the choice is not limited, the opportunity for educated young people to become a student will increase again. Until now, questions of this type have been created and their approval is being carried out. There are a lot of such questions in subjects such as mathematics, history, biology, and chemistry.</p> <p>Last year, due to the pandemic conditions, the possibilities of the applicants were taken into account, and questions of the fourth difficulty level were removed. It won't happen this year. Logical questions are created instead of the fourth level of difficulty. the level of questions in compulsory subjects will be easy.</p> <p><strong>Certificates obtained from various subjects will not be given the maximum points to the applicant</strong></p> <p>At the moment, registration for national certificates in mother tongue, mathematics, chemistry and biology has started. Applicants who have passed the preliminary exam and received a certificate will be given a score in the entrance exam based on the percentage they have earned.</p> <p>The applicant has 2 choices: if he wants, he can get the appropriate score based on the percentage of the points he got in getting the certificate, or even if he has a certificate, he can take the test and score points in the exam as he wishes.</p> <p>So, until this year's entrance exams, there are 5 subjects: you can get a score in advance by taking a certificate in mathematics, mother tongue, chemistry, biology and English.</p> <p><strong>What is the maximum score this year?</strong></p> <p>There will be a total of 45 questions in the compulsory subjects block and 2.1 points will be given for each correct answer. In the block of specialized subjects, there are 2 subjects and one question is evaluated with 3.1 points.</p> <p><strong>Compulsory subjects block:</strong></p> <p><strong>- Mother tongue (Uzbek, Russian or Karakalpak language) -</strong> 15 questions, 2.1 points for each;</p> <p><strong>- Mathematics</strong> - 15 questions for each 2.1 points; </p> <p><strong>- History of Uzbekistan </strong>- 15 questions, 2.1 points for each. </p> <p><strong>Total possible points - 94.5 points. </strong><br/><br/>Up to 1 minute is allotted for each question in the subject of the mother tongue and the history of Uzbekistan, up to 1.5 minutes in mathematics.</p> <p><strong>Subjects in the main block corresponding to the field of study (varies depending on the field):</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Subject 1</strong> - 30 questions, 3.1 points for each;</li> <li><strong>Subject 2 </strong>- 30 questions, 3.1 points for each.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Total possible points - 186 points. <br/></strong><br/>A total of 2 hours will be given for 2 subjects in the main block.</p> <p><strong>The maximum score will be 280.5 points;</strong></p> <p><em>The procedure for taking a test in 5 subjects applies only to state HEIs. As before, this new procedure is not related to military, religious, private, non-state and foreign HEIs.</em></p> <p>- 3 compulsory subjects are not applicable for master's degree.</p> <p>- This procedure in the form of 3+2. applies equally to all forms of undergraduate education (full-time, part-time, evening);</p> <p>There will be no test questions from the subject of Literature in the 15 questions from the subject of the mother tongue (Uzbek, Russian or Karakalpak language) in the mandatory block.</p> <p><strong>200 applicants will be awarded a presidential grant. How will it be allocated?</strong></p> <p>200 people who scored the highest points in the entrance exams this year will receive a presidential grant. But it can be estimated that the number of applicants who will score the maximum points will exceed 200 people.</p> <p>For example, last year due to the simplification of the questions due to the pandemic, the number of applicants who scored the maximum points was close to a thousand. In previous years, there were times when the number of people who scored the maximum score exceeded 200, and when it did not reach 200.</p> <p>The procedure for allocating a presidential grant to 200 people is being developed. The working group will develop a procedure for selecting grant holders if the number of applicants with the maximum score exceeds 200.</p> <p><strong>Entrance exams may be held outdoors this year</strong></p> <p>DTM is considering the option of holding the exams outdoors as well as indoors. The time of the exam takes into account the current epidemiological situation, and if the situation warrants it, the exams can be held outdoors.</p> <p><strong>We are working to ensure that there are no problems with benefits</strong></p> <p>According to the current forecast, more than 1,615,000 applicants are expected to apply. Letters have already been sent to all relevant organizations. Those who have privileges during the document submission process can be seen in their personal cabinet.</p> <p>  — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/toshkentda-turkiy-davlatlar-xalqaro-universiteti-ochiladi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
