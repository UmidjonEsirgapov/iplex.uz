                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>This opportunity is provided only due to the unfilled quota of seats.</strong><br/><strong>If all the seats in a course are filled, it will not be possible to choose it as a sixth course.</strong><br/><strong>Conclusion From 2025 a new opportunity for applicants - the procedure for choosing the sixth course is being introduced.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>5 important facts about choosing the sixth course (2025)</h2> <p>Many applicants have questions about <strong>"choosing the sixth course"</strong>, the new initiative put forward by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in the educational video selector. Below are the 5 most important facts.</p> <h3>1️⃣ When will it start?</h3> <p>This procedure will come into force not from next year, but from <strong>the current year</strong> 2025.</p> <h3>2️⃣ What will the procedure be?</h3> <p>The exact procedure has not been confirmed yet. The responsible ministry is working on several options. <strong>After the announcement of the official order</strong>, additional information will be provided.</p> <h3>3️⃣ For whom?</h3> <p>This opportunity is valid only for applicants who <strong>did not get into all five of their chosen courses</strong>. If you have been accepted to any direction (on the basis of a grant or contract), this procedure does not apply to you.</p> <h3>4️⃣ Is this a super-contract?</h3> <p>No, this is not a super-contract. This opportunity is provided only <strong>on the basis of unfilled seats</strong>. If all the places in a course are filled, it will not be possible to choose it as a sixth course.</p> <h3>5️⃣ Which course can be chosen?</h3> <p>When choosing a sixth course, <strong>the set of subjects must match</strong>. For example, an applicant who has passed the test in biology cannot choose the field of jurisprudence.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>From 2025, a new option for applicants - the procedure for choosing the sixth field is being introduced. This procedure applies only to those who did not get into their five chosen courses. Official rules have not been confirmed yet, so it's important to stay tuned. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kasbiy-talim-tashkilotlarida-ishlab-chiqarish-amaliyotining-yangi-tartibi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>This information comes from official sources.
