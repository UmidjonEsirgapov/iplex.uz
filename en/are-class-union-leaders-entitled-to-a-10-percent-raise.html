                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education is this:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Question: Can the heads of method associations in schools receive a 10% bonus from the director's fund? Based on the Order No. 190 of June 27, class leaders' associations are established in schools.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Question: <strong>Can school leaders receive a 10% bonus from the principal's fund? Then, are the class leaders and method association leaders entitled to receive a bonus?</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> According to the Order of the Ministry of Pre-school and School Education of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 190 dated June 27, 2023, class leaders' associations are established in schools. However, according to Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 823 of September 30, 2019, only the heads of methodical associations in the fields of science have the right to receive a 10 percent monthly bonus. Thus, it is not possible to assign a 10 percent bonus to the heads of class method associations. Although the heads of the class method association are also active as the heads of subject areas, the current regulation only provides for assigning allowances to subject areas.</p> <p>However, the editors of <strong>halqtaliminfo.uz</strong> considered this issue and recommended to the Ministry of Pre-school and School Education to introduce the practice of assigning allowances to class method association heads  — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/3/3-sinf-fransuz-tili" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
