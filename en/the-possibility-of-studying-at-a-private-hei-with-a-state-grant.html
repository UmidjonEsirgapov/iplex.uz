                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>This year, the state allocated 1,200 grants for branches of non-state and foreign HEIs.</strong><br/><strong>This new opportunity makes it possible to study in private higher education institutions with a state grant.</strong><br/><strong>Who is this grant for?</strong><br/><hr/> <p>This year, the state allocated 1,200 grants for branches of non-state and foreign HEIs. This new opportunity creates the opportunity to study with a state grant even in private higher education institutions.</p> <h4>Who is this grant for?</h4> <p>Grants are reserved for the most educated students. Unlike the grants of state educational institutions given to the needy, this grant is intended only for the educated.</p> <h4>How to win a grant?</h4> <p>After the exams of private universities are over, those who want to receive the grant are selected from among the students with the highest scores. In order to win the scholarship, the student signs a tripartite agreement with the Higher Education Institution and the Ministry. This process determines the obligations of the grant recipients to the state.</p> <h4>Terms of return of the grant</h4> <p>The student who studied on the grant must work for the state after graduation. This requirement is a condition for returning the grant funds as an obligation to the state. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/boshlangich-sinf-oqituvchilarining-dars-taqsimoti-qoidalari-va-xatoliklar" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz website.
