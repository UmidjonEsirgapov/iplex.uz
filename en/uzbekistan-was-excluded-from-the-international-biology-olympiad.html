                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Unfortunately, Uzbekistan has been excluded from the 2024 International Biology Olympiad, and the results of all students who participated in the Olympiad have been canceled. </strong><br/><strong>Since this happened to Uzbekistan for the second time, the IBO board may have excluded Uzbekistan from the list of IBO member countries. This Olympiad is held every year and tests students' knowledge and skills in biology. <strong>Uzbekistan</strong> has also been actively participating in this Olympiad since 1997. <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Uzbekistan</strong> was excluded from the 2024 International Biology Olympiad, and the results of all students who participated in the Olympiad were canceled. Worst of all, it was removed from the list of member states of <strong>IBO</strong>.</p> <p>This decision was taken by <strong>IBO</strong>'s board of directors and it was caused by the <strong>Uzbekistan delegation</strong>'s non-compliance with the rules. This may jeopardize the future participation of <strong>Uzbekistan</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Interviewed by Khalqtaliminfo.uz</strong>, an expert (who did not want to be named) said that the <strong>Uzbek delegation</strong> had detected illegal actions, that is, the principles of academic integrity were violated by Uzbek participants during the Olympiad.</p> <p>According to the established regulations, Despite the fact that the main language of the <strong>International Biology Olympiad</strong> is English, the participants have the opportunity to complete the tasks in their native language. In the Olympiad held in <strong>Astana</strong>, <strong>July 7-14, 2024</strong>, it was noted that special symbols were placed on the test tasks of one Uzbek student in the process of translation. A similar situation was observed at the International Biology Olympiad held in South Korea in 2010, and the results of the students were also canceled then. Since this is the second time that such a situation has happened with Uzbekistan, the IBO Board of Directors may have excluded Uzbekistan from the list of IBO member states. It is no secret that violations of the principles of academic integrity occur in some Olympiads, contests and competitions held in Uzbekistan. This seriously harms not only the fairness of elections, but also the overall reputation of the education system.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the violation of the principles of honesty causes students to think that success can be achieved not through hard work and knowledge, but through deception and fraud. We are seeing the sad consequences of this.</p> <p><strong>Uzbekistan</strong>'s exclusion from the <strong>International Biology Olympiad</strong> was a huge blow to the <strong>Uzbekistan education system</strong>. Now the educational policymakers should take the necessary measures to improve this situation. So far, the Ministry of Preschool and School Education has not made an official statement regarding this situation, and has not disclosed information about their readiness to negotiate with international organizations. We think that the Ministry has taken all necessary measures to return to the International Biology Olympiad.  — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kitobni-eslab-qolish-uchun-top-5-tavsiya" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.</strong>
