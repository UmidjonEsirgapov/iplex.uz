                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Many applicants think that after the test, they will choose any one of the five courses if they pass the test. </strong><br/><strong>So, you can't change anything now.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Is it possible to choose any one of the five directions?</strong></p> <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> No, it is not possible to study by choosing any one of the five directions.</p> <p>Most of the applicants have scored <strong>all five directions</strong> after the test. if there is, they think that they will choose any one and read it. This is a wrong idea. After the test, the applicants selected five courses in a row and set their priority.</p> <p>Now, after the final answers are out, the applicants cannot change their chosen courses. The computer itself determines which direction it entered according to <strong>Priority</strong>. Choosing a priority according to <strong>state grant</strong> or <strong>payment-contract</strong> cannot change which direction you entered.</p> <p>When viewing the results of the mandate, on the <strong>mandat.uzbmb.uz</strong> website, if the top of the direction is colored green (grant) or blue or yellow (contract), you will enter that direction. This cannot be changed. It is not possible to go up or down in the sequence of directions.</p> <p><strong>I am on budget, can I change to a contract for another direction?</strong><strong>ANSWER:</strong> No, you can't.</p> <p>So now you can't change anything. You will study there on a grant, if you entered a contract, you will study there on a contract. When you make a choice of course, questions like "what if I switch to this, now what if I switch to that" are not useful. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/slovakiyada-barcha-bosqich-talabalari-va-tadqiqotchilar-uchun-toliq-qoplanuvchi-grant-dasturi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: Prepared based on the information of oliygoh.uz
