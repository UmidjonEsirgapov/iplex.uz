They take a test in two subjects.</p> <p>«The first subject is clear. As the second subject for the test, the subject of block 3, which was included in the test process last year, will be given. For example, last year the 3rd subject was English, but this year it will be the second subject," said Khalikov.</p> <p>He added that only the order for creative subjects will remain unchanged.</p> <p>The relevant decision of the State Admissions Commission is expected to be announced soon.</p> <p>"There are a lot of disputes among the members of the working group on this. it happened. Yes, this process could have been organized for creative test takers before the test, but now if we told OTM to take creative tests before the test, they would not be able to. For example, journalism, architecture. Now the situation is such that everyone has to adapt and get used to it. For example, creative exams in the system of the Ministry of Defense are expected to be conducted in the form of a full test this year," said Abduvali Khalikov in a telephone conversation with a Kun.uz reporter.</p> <p>For information, it was decided to conduct a test in one subject and professional (creative) exams when entering 13 educational fields of the bachelor's degree program.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/6/uk8IKVeTwqzGFiABlLAESswLe7i5fcHG.jpg"/></p> <p>  — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/universitetga-ishga-kirish-uchun-10-000-dollar-pora-berishdi-bu-qaysi-universitet-ozi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: prepared based on the information of the oliygoh.uz site.
