                Today's most relevant news in education was:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>It was reported in the Guardian newspaper.</strong><br/><strong>The book was picked up by schoolboy Leonard Eubank in 1911.</strong><br/><strong>Four years later, during the First World War, despite his poor eyesight, he was drafted into the war and He was killed in battle on February 23, 1916.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>A collection of works of <strong>George Byron</strong> taken from a school library in <strong>Cumbria</strong>, England, was returned to the school <strong>113 years later</strong>. This was reported in the <strong>Guardian</strong> newspaper. The book was received by <strong>Leonard Eubank</strong>, who was a school student in 1911.</p> <p>Leonard Eubank was born in 1893 and graduated from school in 1911. He later entered Queen's College, Oxford University. Four years later, during <strong>World War</strong>, despite his poor eyesight, he enlisted in the war and was <strong>killed in action</strong> on February 23, 1916.</p> <p>Leonard Eubank was recognized in the school's hero list as "the best, honest and loyal Englishman". According to the representatives of the school, this book, taken from the library before the First World War, after a century and more than ten years, has finally returned to its place. This event may go down in history as one of the "latest library books" in the world.
