                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The decision states that students will study in the building of Tashkent State Technical University until the new building is finished, and the new building will be commissioned by January 1, 2022.</strong><br/><strong>The Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education is responsible for this.</strong><br/><strong>Ministry of Energy. and OTFIV has not yet received a response.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>It is said that the graduate students of the Tashkent branch of the federal state budget university "MEI" National Research University of Russia are being forced to transfer their studies to another place. The branch management wants to disperse the graduates because they cannot get a license from Russia. src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/10/N6hm6n2g8UBLSLmTWHfG35ulX5xI62Iq.jpg"/&gt;</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/10/2SOxTtL9eDD47r1ep8rP7v7WjR869_LW.jpg"/></p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/10/gR32zN8fn4OSNLoCCIGveCGyG_wAuaRi.jpg"/></p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/10/xU_GyZxYs5Y_5_MTYrLqA5pQO76cSEyL.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>There is a building, no license</strong></p> <p>In 2019, a decision will be made to open a branch of the Federal State Budget University "MEI" National Research University in Tashkent. It states that the branch should accept students from 2019/2020. The decision states that students will study in the building of Tashkent State Technical University until the new building is finished, and the new building will be commissioned by January 1, 2022. The address of the building is 1 Yogdu street, Moykurgan massif, Almazor district.</p> <p>Students who contacted Kun.uz said that they have been studying in the TDTU building since the first stage, that is, from the 2020/2021 academic year. Despite the fact that the new building is ready, the branch has not moved there. </p> <p><strong>Students without a diploma</strong></p> <p>The first graduates of the branch will be in the 2022/2023 academic year. But they cannot be called branch graduates, because these students were "transferred" to other universities from the 4th stage and dispersed. In an interview with Kun.uz, ​​one of such graduates said that last year they were lost, not knowing where to study, and more than 100 students in the 4th year were forced to "transfer" to other universities. At that time, the students went to the new building allocated for the branch and sent a video message asking to meet with the officials. the situation is repeating itself. A group of students received a voluntary-compulsory offer from the management of the branch to transfer to TDTU or to the main building of the branch in Russia. "We would have. But we handed it over to the branch considering that it would be expensive. Now they are telling us that they cannot give us a diploma," said one of the students. </p> <p>For information, the 1-year contract of the branch in Tashkent is 18 million soums, and in the university itself (Russia) it is about 3 thousand dollars.</p> <p><strong>Dispersed graduates</strong></p> <p>After the graduating students protested against the "perevod", a meeting was held with the vice-rectors of the branch on November 13 (the video of the meeting is in the editorial office). After the problem was not resolved, on November 15, OTFIV, branch rector Hajiyev and representatives of the Federal State Budget College of the National Research University "MEI" of Russia were called and another meeting was held. The student said that at the meeting they were offered to go to study in Russia or to "perevod" to universities in Uzbekistan. It can be seen from the video that neither the students nor their parents agreed with this.</p> <p><strong>The words of the officials are not consistent with each other</strong></p> <p>Kun.uz was presented to Kun.uz with the representatives of the branch and the students of the federal state budget university "MEI" of Russia. They said that the document did not reach them. However, the branch rector, Hojiakbar Daliyev, wrote something different in the student Telegram group. In a message written on October 5, 2023, Daliyev said that the Ministry of Energy did not transfer 10 billion soums in this regard. It is stated that the establishment documents of the branch should be developed and agreed upon in the prescribed manner. The structure of the branch should be approved in 2 months. The Ministry of Higher and Secondary Education is responsible for this. electric power stations" JSC, "Uzbekistan National Electric Networks" JSC, "Territorial Electric Networks" JSC and "Uzbekgidroenergo" JSC should be financed.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/10/aCkisv1lzY9gpbg_bMuXMiYLeg_aBnJ5.jpg"/></p> <p>The building was supposed to be handed over by January 1, 2022. The main contractor was Enter Engineering Pte. Ltd. However, the main contractor completed the project in 2023, in addition, the Russian side is dissatisfied with the lack of laboratory equipment src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/10/yxNAREw1tSjXKKx9fRbkfOCJYLnuqVgE.jpg"/&gt;</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/10/pDNkS2wT-eKyT_LdSGLf3l4TwY6RU-tI.jpg"/></p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/10/ibmSRSCgajVNrbRY8m_VqzknccHFmCyx.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>Unanswered questions</strong></p> <p><em>The most important question is why students are accepted to study where they do not have a license? didn't happen?</em></p> <p><em>When the building was accepted from the contracting organization, weren't representatives from Russia invited or not (not known to Kun.uz)?</em></p> <p><em>What is the reason why the graduates have not been taught since the beginning of their studies, what will be their future?</em></p> <p><em>Where did the graduates of the university get their diplomas last year? received?</em></p> <p><em>When will the branch receive a license and has OTFIV started its studies? prefers to observe from the sidelines.</em></p> <p><strong>Zuhra Abduhalimova, journalist</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oliygoh-uz-jamoasi-ishga-taklif-qiladi-rus-tilidan-tarjimon-ishga-olinadi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>This information was obtained from official sources..
