                Today's most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>The DAAD grant program is fully funded and a monthly stipend is also provided.</strong><br/><strong>IMPORTANT When we interviewed many grant winners, they said that the most important factor in winning a grant is the motivation letter.</strong><br/><strong>Language certificate - a document required for many grants.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Now we will try to answer some of the most frequently asked questions.</p> <ol> <li><strong>What grants are there?</strong></li> </ol> <ul> <li>There are many types of grants. In particular, <em><strong>government grants</strong></em>and <em><strong>special grants organized by the university</strong></em> are the most common grants today. Government grants have more stakeholders than other grants, meaning government grants are <strong>fully funded</strong>. Recipients of government grants often:</li> </ul> <ul> <li style="list-style-type: none;"> <ul> <li>tuition fee waivers;</li> <li>travel, insurance and visa expenses covered;</li> <li>a monthly stipend;</li> <li>in some cases, free accommodation and food.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>We can cite the following as examples of government grants:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Chevening UK Government Scholarship </strong>- the opportunity to study a master's degree in Great Britain for free, all costs are fully funded. Acceptance for this grant is currently open. You can find out more through <strong>this link</strong>.</li> <li><strong>DAAD scholarships -</strong> has organized special grants for study or language learning for master's degree or PhD in Germany. The DAAD grant program is also fully funded and a monthly stipend is provided. You can find out about DAAD grants below: <ul> <li><strong>DAAD scholarships: </strong>The opportunity to study in Germany on the basis of a full grant for master's and doctoral studies. Admission is currently ongoing for this program as well, and applications are accepted until October 29 each year. You can find out about the conditions of application through <strong>this link</strong>;</li> <li>DAAD summer course - fully funded summer language courses in Germany for students who want to learn the German language for free. You can find out more about the program through <strong>this link</strong>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><em><strong>We talked to our compatriot who won both grants of the DAAD organization</strong></em>. During the interview, our hero told from his experience what is the most important factor for winning a grant. <strong>You can read our conversation through this link </strong>.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Erasmus Mundus -</strong> A fully funded grant program for all students, teachers to study and improve their skills in Europe. The directions of the program are very broad. The possibilities are similar. In general, it is a great opportunity to study for free;</li> <li><strong>Fulbright Foreign Student Program</strong> is a fully funded grant program for Uzbek students who want to continue their master's degree at US universities. All expenses are covered by the government;</li> <li><strong>UGRAD</strong> is a one-semester exchange program for undergraduate students in the USA. No language certificate required. All expenses covered;</li> <li><strong>FLEX </strong>- opportunity to live and study in the USA for 1 year, all expenses covered, for school or high school/college students. Currently, the application for this grant is also ongoing. <strong>You can learn more through this link</strong>;</li> </ul> <p>There are many other types of government grants. Opportunities and benefits are also many. At the same time, it will not be easy to win these grants because the competition is high. It is recommended to start preparation earlier!</p> <p><strong> 2. What should be important to win scholarships?</strong></p> <p>This question has become one of the most frequently asked questions. To win a grant, the <strong><em>first thing</em></strong> you need to do is to learn more about the grant. What kind of grant are you applying for, what are its requirements, is your age, degree, major suitable for the program? The most basic documents that are constantly requested for grants:</p> <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"> <li><strong>CV </strong>- biography. This is quite different from our biography in Uzbek, which usually consists of one or one and a half pages. You can learn the most important information about writing a CV through <strong>this link </strong>;</li> <li><strong>Motivational letter </strong>- an essay of maximum 2 pages detailing the reasons why you are applying for this grant. In the motivational letter, it should be stated that the candidate can reveal his knowledge, potential and leadership skills, why he is applying for this course, what he can give to the chosen university, and why this candidate should be selected for the grant. <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> When we talked with many grant winners, they mentioned that <u><strong>the most important factor in winning a grant </strong></u>is the motivation letter. It will clearly and in detail reflect the candidate's goals, the benefits he/she can get from the grant program, and how it will benefit the candidate's future career. When writing a motivational letter, it is necessary to speak clearly, with details and facts rather than with general information. Because it is not possible to determine the level of the candidate through general information. Set a clear goal, what field are you in, how is the grant program related to your field, why do you want to participate in this grant? Give everything in detail;</li> <li><strong>Recommendation </strong>- a letter of recommendation from the university or workplace expressing the good aspects of the candidate. A letter of recommendation is also important in winning a scholarship because it can be used to gauge the candidate's suitability for the program. That's why, when preparing a motivational letter and a letter of recommendation, never <em><strong>copy</strong></em> other people's work, do not allow plagiarism. This will be noticed by the members of the examining board;</li> <li><strong>Diploma/Grades</strong>- a document representing the candidate's academic performance. In some cases, the price may play a role. Although this document is requested for almost all grants, the grade is not very important in winning the grant. There are many students with 90% marks, IELTS 8.0, but who did not win a grant. Therefore, <strong>if your grades are not what you want</strong>, do not lose heart, try. You can be accepted for a grant if you explain why your grades are not excellent in your motivation letter. Of course, this does not mean that it will happen even if I do not study. The better the grades, the higher your chances of winning.</li> <li><strong>Language certificate</strong> is a required document for many grants. Usually IELTS in English is at least 6.0. TOEFL iBT 90 or equivalent is required. A high language proficiency certificate hardly plays a role in winning a scholarship. If the language certificate is sufficient to study at that university and to understand the knowledge given. Therefore, candidates who have obtained 7.0 in IELTS should write a good motivational letter clarifying their goals and directions rather than trying to get 8+. But getting a higher score from them gives an advantage for admission to the program. Another important factor in the scholarship process is that the candidate is socially active. Because behind all great things lies the cultivation of a useful person for the society and the establishment of mutual relations. <p><strong>When you visit the page of Oligoh.uz</strong>, you will always see one sentence:</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A high goal leads to victory.</strong></p> <p style="text-align: left;">Therefore, always have the right goal. and don't stop until you get there! <strong>Good luck to everyone!</strong></p> <p>  — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/2024-2025-oquv-yili-uchun-akademik-litseylarga-kirish-test-sinovlari-jadvali" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.</li></ul>
