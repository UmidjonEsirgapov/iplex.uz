                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Why do you need a motivation letter?</strong><br/><strong>Write it short, concise and clear.</strong><br/><strong>The idea and main text should be yours. an essay is also required. These essays are usually called "motivation letter," "statement of purpose," or "cover letter." <p>The title doesn't matter. All of them are aimed at defining the same goal, that is, who you are, your goals for studying at this university.</p> <p><strong>Why do you need a ``motivation letter''?</strong></p> <p>A natural question may arise that what is the point of such a written work. Therefore, first of all, we will find out why this requirement is important.</p> <p>Let's say that 10 people are applying for one place for admission. All have excellent grades in school or undergrad; IELTS/TOEFL results are also the same. Which of them should be accepted?</p> <p>This is where your written essays come in handy. Because if 10 people write an essay on the same topic, it is obvious that 10 will write differently. Which of them wrote well, as a person, as a student, as a future specialist, which one is smarter, and whose goals are more clear, you can find out by looking at this 1-2 page letter. That is why essays are one of the important criteria for admission to higher educational institutions abroad.</p> <p><strong>Important points to pay attention to when writing an essay</strong></p> <p>Essays are usually set to a very short length. There will be requirements of no more than 1000 or 500 words, and these <strong>requirements must be followed</strong>.</p> <p>While it is important to write your essay fluently and without errors, the main purpose of writing an essay for you is not to test how you write in English. You have already submitted a written work for this in the TOEFl/IELTS exams.</p> <p>The purpose of writing an individual essay is to check your uniqueness as a person, how you can contribute to the study environment of a higher education institution, and how you can make the best use of the opportunity given to you. So, you should reveal these aspects of yourself through the essay.</p> <p><strong>Write short, concise and clear. </strong>People who check your writing will read hundreds, if not thousands, of essays in a day. Therefore, there should be something that catches their attention by "sparkling" when they look at it. Avoid generalizations. Writing "My goal is to study in the USA and return to my country to contribute to the development of my country" is not a mistake, but it is a very simple and general statement. This sentence doesn't tell you what makes you different from others.</p> <p><strong>Personalize the subject. </strong>That is, start with a personal event that affects a person. Briefly describe an event that motivated you to learn, study, and changed your life. Americans love personal stories.</p> <p><strong>Let there be an introduction, main points and a conclusion. </strong>For example, if you are answering the question of why you want to study at this university or in this field, first write a 1-2 sentence answer to this question with a general introduction. Then give at least 2-3 specific reasons or examples to support this. Or, start the essay directly from a personal story, from an event that happened to you, develop this story during writing, and connect it to why you decided to study in this field. </p></strong>Perhaps mention information that complements it or explains your success on your resume. <p><strong>Show your leadership potential. </strong>Americans love leaders. You may be a young man or woman applying for a bachelor's or master's degree; therefore, you are not expected to be a global success or leader. You may have been a class leader at school or university, you may have led a sports team; Don't forget to mention your successes like this. Activities such as extracurricular activities and volunteering are highly valued in America. You play some kind of sport; you go to a music club; or maybe you won a competition, don't be shy to mention these, and these jobs don't have to be related to the field you want to study. In the West, those who engage in activities outside their field are respected. For example, if you apply in the field of information technology, the fact that you are a city champion in boxing or that you like to play the piano is only a plus for you. These should definitely be mentioned. That is, few people manage to succeed in several types of activities that are different from each other. If you have this aspect, this is your achievement.</p> <p><strong>Reread what you wrote. </strong>Don't put off writing your essay until the last day of submission. Writing a good essay takes a long time. Re-read what you wrote after 2-3 days. Then new ideas will come to improve it. There will be opportunities to do better.</p> <p><strong>Show your writing to others to get feedback and corrections. </strong>A friend or mentor can correct mistakes and provide additional feedback for further improvement. But it is not correct to edit the essay to the extent that it is completely written or rewritten by another person. The idea and body text must be your own.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion. </strong>Write in simple language. Writing complex sentences and long sentences doesn't make you look smarter. The important thing is to be free of stylistic and grammatical errors and the content should be original and rich.</p> <p>As I wrote above, the purpose of the "Motivation letter" is not to show that you can write fluently, but to reveal your advantage over others.</p> <p><strong>Behzod Mamadiev's article</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/super-kontrakt-narxi-va-hisoblash-2025-qollanma" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
