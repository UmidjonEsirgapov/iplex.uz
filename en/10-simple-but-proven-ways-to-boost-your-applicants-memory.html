                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>And after a few more minutes of confusion, turn to the textbook.</strong><br/><strong>This method can be applied to family members before the exam.</strong><br/><strong>Children conducted an experiment with 50 volunteers and proved that the right time to learn information fisting is useful for memory retention.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Have you heard about 10 ways to remember for a long time?</strong></p> <p>Here are 10 simple ways for you not to forget what we read before the exam. Here we go!</p> <p><strong>Method 1.</strong> Modern cognitivists laugh at those who memorize tickets without understanding them. Otherwise, they try to read all the sections of the textbook in the hope that the formulas will stick in their brains. There are more effective ways to memorize the lectures you missed during the year. American researchers and authors of the book "<u>Remembering Everything: Remembering Knowledge Without Memorizing and Boring</u>" suggest a method called "<strong>remembering</strong>". This is when a person studies a topic, collects his thoughts, closes the page with his hand, perceives what the topic is about, and controls himself well according to what he has read or extracts the necessary information based on the content of the reference points. Method 2. The German psychologist Ebbinghaus was interested in the question of how to remember something that was forgotten 100 years ago. In the course of the experiment, he got results that will be known on the eve of the exam: <strong>60% of the information received in the first hour is forgotten</strong>, when you use a cheat sheet on the phone, after 10 hours, 35% of the information remains in the memory. Psychologists reject the cheat sheet, carefully observed the experiment of Ebbenghaus and suggested that people repeat it at intervals:</p> <p>the first - immediately after reading, the second - after 20 minutes, the third - after 8 hours, and the fourth - after a day.</p> <p>We turn to methods that make it easier to remember.</p> <p><strong>Method 3.</strong> Ebbengause discovered the "edge result" method. The purpose of opening this is that the information located at the beginning or end of the text is easy to remember. Therefore, when preparing tickets, try to place important materials in the introduction and conclusion.</p> <p><strong>Method 4.</strong> Something interesting and rich in emotional colors will be remembered quickly. If you were asked to memorize a list of the bones of the wrist joints, imagine that these joints belong to a beautiful girl, and you are helping her by holding the lower part of the elbow bone as she gets off the tram.</p> <p><strong>Method 5. </strong>We return to the authors of the book "<u>Remembering knowledge without memorizing and getting bored</u>". This is what they require - try to draw a conclusion before getting acquainted with the finished result. For example, when you get a ticket, what else can you say about it besides the exclamation "Uh". And after a few more minutes of confusion, turn to the textbook.</p> <p><strong>Method 6.</strong> Write the important thing by hand. Studies show that after writing down information, even if we lose the notebook, we remember it strongly.</p> <p><strong>Method 7.</strong> Read aloud the chapter on atomic physics. Your family members may not like it, but you can use your voice, ears and eyes to remember this interesting information much faster than just looking at it in a book. Skip one of them and tell him a few paragraphs. Storytelling cements many ideas and information in the brain. (Barbara Oakley, "Think Like a Mathematician: How to Solve Any Problem Quickly and Efficiently?")</p> <p><strong>Method 9</strong>. The test conducted by scientists from the University of Montclair (New Jersey) in America forces the hand to make a fist. Children conducted an experiment with 50 volunteers and proved that making a right-handed fist during the acquisition of information is useful for memory retention. Apparently, when we make a fist, the areas related to memory are activated in the brain.</p> <p><strong>Method 10.</strong> Do not sit in one place with a book, go from room to room. This is not recommended by experts to distract you from meditation. Changing the place of study helps to improve memory. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/7/7-sinf-milliy-istiqlol-goyasi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p>
