                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>From January 1, 2025, a 50 percent bonus will be paid to teachers who teach mother tongue, literature, and history subjects in general education schools and who have a national certificate.</strong><br/><strong>This decision caused discussions and caused protests among teachers. </strong><br/><strong>Additional explanation of the Ministry: a 50 percent bonus will be paid only to teachers who teach native language and literature subjects and have a national certificate.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Starting from January 1, 2025, a 50 percent bonus will be paid to teachers in general education schools who teach native language and literature, history subjects and have a national certificate.</strong> But this privilege does not apply to teachers teaching Uzbek language in Russian classes. This decision caused discussions and protests among teachers.</p> <p>Teachers of the Uzbek language consider this decision "not fair". They say that Uzbek language teachers have a national certificate and contribute to the development of the state language. One of the teachers addressed the Kun.uz site and expressed the following opinion: "We also serve the development of the state language. In the process of obtaining a national certificate, we fulfill the same requirements as native language teachers. Why are we deprived of the privilege?" subject, and the 20 percent bonus will be preserved for Uzbek language teachers in Russian classrooms.</p> <p><strong>Additional explanation of the Ministry:</strong>50 percent bonus will be paid only to teachers who teach native language and literature subjects and have a national certificate. This applies to the following schools:</p> <ul> <li>Uzbek language and literature in schools where education is conducted in Uzbek;</li> <li>Russian language and literature in schools where education is conducted in Russian;</li> <li>Karakalpak language and literature in schools where education is conducted in Karakalpak.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Protests:</strong>Linguist and pedagogues suggest to reconsider this decision, to introduce a special national certificate for the Uzbek language or to apply a 50 percent increase to the subject of the Uzbek language. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/16-yoshga-tolgan-bitiruvchi-id-karta-pasport-olmasa-otmga-hujjat-topshira-olmaydi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
