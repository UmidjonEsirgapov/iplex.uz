                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Is it possible to study the master's degree on a contract basis and get a diploma with 2 years of work experience written on my "trudovoy"?</strong><br/><strong>Also, the period of 1 year of working at the school in the 2nd year of the master's degree is also counted as work experience.</strong><br/><strong>On the basis of the contract for the master's degree It is absolutely unreasonable to demand work experience or other similar conditions for those who have studied. Is it possible to study a master's degree on a contract basis and get a diploma with 2 years of work experience written on my "trudovoy"? I also worked at the school for 1 year in the second year of the master's degree. <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In the Republic of Uzbekistan, issues related to length of service are regulated by the law "On state pension provision of citizens". is counted. That is, the 2-year study period of your master's degree is the work experience. Also, the period of 1 year of working at the school in the 2nd year of the master's degree is added to the length of service. It is absolutely unreasonable to demand work experience or other similar conditions in relation to those who studied at the master's degree on the basis of a contract. Because the "Regulation on the Master's Degree" does not specify the requirement of "work experience" to receive a diploma. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/bu-yil-butunlay-yangi-ochilgan-yonalishlarni-yuklab-oling" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.</strong>
