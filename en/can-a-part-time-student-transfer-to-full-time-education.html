                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>💡Solution: As you can see, the decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers set 2 different rules, one of which says that it is possible to transfer studies from part-time (special part-time) education to full-time education, and the other says that it is not possible.</strong><br/><strong>This law According to Article 16, in the event of a discrepancy between normative legal documents of equal legal force, the provisions of the document adopted later shall apply.</strong><br/><strong>Therefore, the provision established by the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 59 of January 31, 2020 shall be valid. can he transfer his studies? </strong> <p><strong> ✅ Answer: yes, it is possible. </strong></p> <p><strong>Fundamentals: </strong>Clause 8 of the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 59 dated January 31, 2020 of the Cabinet of Ministers "On approval of regulations on the procedure for organizing part-time (special part-time) and evening (shift) education at a higher educational institution" dated November 21, 2017 Clause 12 of Annex 1 to Decision No. 930 is stated in the following version:</p> <p>«<strong>12. It is allowed to move from part-time (special part-time) education to full-time education and transfer from one educational field of part-time (special part-time) education to another." <p><strong>Problem:</strong> It should be noted that, from the point of view of legal technique, when introducing this change, the drafters of the decision forgot one small aspect. The processes related to the transfer of students' studies are regulated on the basis of a completely different decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, which was mentioned at the beginning of our article. However, the change regarding the permission to transfer studies from part-time (special part-time) education to full-time education was not included in that main decision. Clause 9 of the Regulation on the procedure for transfer, reinstatement and expulsion of students of higher education institutions has not yet been amended, and this clause stipulates the rejection of applications for transfer from part-time (special correspondence) education to full-time education and from one educational field of correspondence (special correspondence) education to another field of education.</p> <p>💡<strong>Solution: </strong>As you can see, the decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers specify <strong>2 different rules</strong>, one of which says that it is possible to transfer studies from part-time (special part-time) education to full-time education, and the other says that it is not possible.<strong> What is the solution in such a situation? </strong>That is, which decision should be applied in practice? The answer to this can be found in the Law "On Regulatory-Legal Documents". According to Article 16 of this law, in case of differences between normative-legal documents with equal legal force, the provisions of the document adopted later shall apply. Both documents, which differ in the matter under our consideration, are of "equal legal force", that is, both are decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers. If one of the reasons was the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, and the other was the decision of the President, then the rule of the President's decision would undoubtedly apply. This is just for information. Based on the requirement of the law, we learned that the provisions of the document adopted later apply. Therefore, the rule established by <strong>Decision of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 59 of January 31, 2020</strong> will come into force.</p> <p> ✅ <strong>Conclusion:</strong> starting from this year, students will study from part-time (special part-time) education to full-time education and from one educational field of part-time (special part-time) education to another. can move.</p> <p>Kushnudbek Khudoyberdiyev — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/talim-krediti-bilan-bogliq-masalalar-boyicha-banklarning-ishonch-telefon-raqami" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How do you look at this news?
