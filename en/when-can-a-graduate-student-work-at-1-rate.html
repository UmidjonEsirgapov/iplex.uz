                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>When can you work 1 rate?</strong><br/><strong>It is against the law to restrict your right to work because you are a student.</strong><br/><strong>Working depends on your will, on the will of the head of the higher education institution where you are studying. no!</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Hello! I am a 2nd year graduate student. When can 1 rate work? When they entered their main job, they made a rate of 0.75.</strong></p> <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Both a student studying at the bachelor's degree and a student studying at the master's degree have the right to work. The legislation does not limit the right of students to work, on the contrary, the legislation stipulates that students have the right to work. </li> </ul> <p>It is against the law to limit your right to work because you are a student. Earn 1 rate if you want. Earn 0.75 rate if you want. Earn 0.5 rate if you want. Earn 0.25 rate if you want. If you don't want to, don't work.</p> <p><strong>Pay attention! Working depends on your will, not on the will of the head of the higher education institution where you are studying! But...</strong></p> <p>However, if you work, there is only one requirement: <strong>YOUR WORK ACTIVITY SHOULD NOT NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUR STUDY ACTIVITY. IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE REMAINING ISSUES, ESPECIALLY THE ISSUES OF WORK AND REST, ON THE BASIS OF LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS.</strong></p> <p></p> <p><strong>Sources: </strong></p> <p>Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan; </p> <p>Labor Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan;</p> <p>Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan "On Education";</p> <p>Regulation on Higher Education. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oliygoh/namangan-davlat-chet-tillari-instituti" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: Prepared based on the information of the oliygoh.uz site.
