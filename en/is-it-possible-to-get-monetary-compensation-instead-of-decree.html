                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Many women are interested in the question of whether it is possible to receive paid compensation instead of pregnancy and maternity leave (or "decree"). It is necessary.</strong><br/><strong>This means that it is not possible to receive compensation without taking leave.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Many women are interested in the question of whether it is possible to receive <strong>paid compensation</strong> instead of pregnancy and maternity leave (or "decree"). According to <strong>Article 151</strong> of the Labor Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the use of social holidays should be carried out in the original form. This means that it is not possible to receive compensation without going on vacation.</p> <p><strong>According to Article 149 of the Labor Code</strong>, social vacations include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Pregnancy and maternity leave</strong></li> <li><strong>Child care leave</strong></li> <li><strong>Creative vacation</strong></li> </ul> <p>These holidays cannot be exchanged for paid compensation. That is, there is no right to receive compensation without going on vacation.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> According to Article 233 of the Labor Code, women are given 70 calendar days from the 30th week of pregnancy to childbirth and 56 calendar days after childbirth. Compensation will be paid during this leave.</p> <p>These legal norms are designed to protect women's health and their rights, and were developed to ensure full use of social leave — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/farmatsiya-yonalishi-uchun-79-nafar-talabgorlarning-birortasi-oqishini-kochira-olmagan" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
