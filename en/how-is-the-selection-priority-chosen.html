This choice has a direct impact on the basis on which you will study - <strong>state grant or payment contract</strong> and <strong>in which direction</strong>. <h3>Types of selection priority</h3> <p>There are 2 types of selection priority in the DTM system:</p> <h4>1. "State grant" priority</h4> <p>If the applicant chooses the "State grant" priority, the following procedure applies:</p> <ul> <li> <p>In each field of study, he first participates in the selection based on the <strong>state grant</strong>;</p> </li> <li> <p>If he cannot get the grant, consider the <strong>payment-contract</strong> </p> </li> </ul> <p>This method is suitable for those who want to enter any direction based on a grant.</p> <h4>2. "Educational field" priority</h4> <p>If the applicant chooses the "Educational field" priority, the following actions will be taken:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Selection for each field will be <strong>sequentially</strong>;</p> </li> <li> <p>For each field, selection will be made first on the basis of the grant, then on the basis of the contract;</p> </li> <li> <p>The first directions are suitable for those who are important.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Which priority should be chosen?</h3> <ul> <li> <p>If the <strong>main goal is to enter studies based on a grant, regardless of the direction</strong>, then the priority <strong>"State grant"</strong> is chosen.</p> </li> <li> <p>If If <strong>it is important to study in the fields of your choice, even if there is a contract, <strong>"Education field"</strong> priority is chosen.</strong></p> </li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The priority of choice is an important factor that determines on what basis and in which field the applicant will study. Each applicant should make a decision based on his wishes, opportunities and priorities.
