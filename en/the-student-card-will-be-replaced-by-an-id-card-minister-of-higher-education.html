In it, the minister touched on digitization in higher education.</p> <p>"From today, the rectors must realize that in the higher education system of Uzbekistan, the journal and rating notebook will not be in paper form. The budget draft was passed to transfer the student ID card to the ID card and store all information on it. This is also currently under discussion," said Abduqodir Tashkulov.</p> <p>According to the minister, the lesson schedule approved by the vice-rector in A1 and A2 format, which is visible when entering each faculty, is not an indicator.</p> <p>"The minister should take the student's smartphone and show it in the application when the officials visit," he said.</p> <p>The minister is also embarrassed in front of his foreign colleagues. It was reported that the minister spoke about the quality of education in HEIs and the main problems in the credit-module system and the lack of a system and understanding in the organization of independent education today. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/birinchi-kurslarni-universitetdagi-ilk-haftada-nimalar-kutyapti" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> </div> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
