                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Will the test be given from 10 compulsory subject blocks or 15? It is known that due to the quarantine, the number of questions was reduced, and actually there were 15 compulsory block subjects reduced to 10.</strong><br/><strong>Now the quarantine no.</strong><br/><strong>If this procedure is reviewed and changed by the State Admissions Commission, we will inform you, it will be announced together with the complex of subjects, Sardor Rajabov added. subjects were reduced to 10. There is no quarantine now. Will the number of questions be increased?</strong> <p>It was announced in a voice chat held on Khushnudbek Khudoyberdiyev's channel with the participation of the deputy director of DTM. Sardar Rajabo said that this matter does not depend on the State Test Center. This is confirmed by the state admissions commission. According to the deputy director, there should be 15 rather than 10 tests, because it is a little more difficult to determine the applicant's knowledge with 10 tests. For this reason, 15 were invited earlier.</p> <p>If this procedure is reviewed and changed by the State Admissions Commission, we will inform you, it will be announced together with the subject complex, added Sardor Rajabov. Unfortunately, the set of subjects has already been announced after this interview, no specific news about the number of compulsory subject questions has been announced. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/super-kontrakt-narxlari-yonalishlar-kesimida-2" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
