                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>That is, applicants have to fight not only with others through their knowledge, but first of all with themselves. will be.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>A minimum score limit is set in the tests every year. That is, applicants must fight not only with others, but also with themselves through their knowledge. If the applicant does not get the minimum score, even if there is a place in the quota, he will not be accepted as a student.</p> <p>This year, the minimum requirement is the same as in previous years:</p> <p>For a payment contract - 56.7 points;</p> <p>For a state grant - 68 points.</p> <p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p> <p>I will explain with a specific example.</p> <p>The photo above shows the results of the 2019 mandate. In 2019, a total of 24 quotas were allocated to the Russian group of the "Electrical engineering, electrical mechanics and electrical technologies" department of the Tashkent Institute of Railway Transport Engineers in Figure 1. Of these, 4 grants and 20 contracts.</p> <p>However, if we look at the results, it can be seen that the 22nd, 23rd and 24th ranked applicants scored less than 56.7 points. Therefore, they were not accepted as students, even though they were within the quota.</p> <p>See Figure 2. Samarkand Institute of Veterinary Medicine in the field of "Biotechnology" has been allocated 1 targeted admission quota for the state grant for Andijan region. 10 people applied for that 1 grant place in 2019. But all 10 applicants scored less than 68 points. So, no one was able to enter the 1 place allocated for that state grant. It is empty.</p> <p><strong>This is what the minimum score is.</strong></p> <p>To be honest, we should be worried that our young people cannot score only 56.7 points at a time when those who choose only 1 option for every question are lucky and get 60-70 points. For example, in 2022, 51.2% of applicants could not score even 56.7 points, that is, more than half of the applicants could not even record the result of 30%. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/yangi-oquv-yili-1-kurslar-uchun-3-sentyabrdan-yuqori-kurslarga-8-sentyabrdan-boshlanadi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.
