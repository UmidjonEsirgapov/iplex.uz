                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The group of women who can apply for a grant is quite wide: women from low-income families; women who are being raised in single-parent families, i.e. women whose father or mother has died; Daughters of single women (men) raising two or more children under the age of 14, living separately from other relatives; families who do not have their own homes and live in rent; one or both of the parents are unemployed and are registered at employment assistance centers as jobseekers; women from families with children with disabilities; Districts where the coverage level of highly educated women is two or more times lower than the average indicators of the republic, as well as female children from families living in remote and hard-to-reach areas (with the condition of working in their territory for 3 years - which districts are detailed below).</strong><br/><strong>According to the Ministry, the request for the applicant to submit a reference letter was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on June 23. It is specified in the regulation approved by the decision "On the procedure for recommending women to participate in the competition and organizing their admission within the parameters of admission to higher education institutions based on additional state grants". class="main-img__caption"&gt;Starting from the admission for the 2020/21 academic year, an additional 4 percent grant will be allocated for women based on the admission rates based on the total state grant. This four percent means a quota of 940 grants this year. A Kun.uz reporter gathered detailed information about this news. <div class="main-img__caption">First of all, it should be said that this privilege is valid for full-time bachelor's education and only for entering the chosen first course.</div> <div class="main-img__caption"> </div> <div class="main-img__caption"> </div> <div class="main-img__caption"><strong>Who will receive the grant?</strong></div>  <p>The group of women who can apply for the grant is quite wide:</p> <ul> <li>women from low-income families;</li> <li>women who are brought up in single-parent families, i.e., women whose father or mother has died;</li> <li>two under 14 years of age and daughters of single women (men) raising more children and living separately from other relatives;</li> <li>families without private housing, living in rented accommodation;</li> <li>one or both of the parents are unemployed and registered as jobseekers at employment assistance centers;</li> <li>women and girls from families with children with disabilities;</li> <li>Districts where the coverage rate of women with higher education is two or more times lower than the average of the republic, as well as female children from families living in remote and hard-to-reach areas (with the condition of having worked in their own territory for 3 years - which districts are detailed below).</li> </ul> <p><strong>What documents are required?</strong></p> <p>Belonging to the above categories. women can apply for a grant to working groups organized in the district and city departments of the Ministry of Neighborhood and Family Support in the period from June 24 to July 10.</p> <p>The set of documents will consist of the following:</p> <ul> <li>an application to the head of the district (city) Neighborhood and Family Support Department <em>(initially, the application to the minister was announced to be written. However, in the last option, it was confirmed that the application should be written in the name of the head of the district (city) department of the ministry)</em></li> <li>documents confirming that one of the specified requirements for receiving a grant (with an attachment); (on the basis of 11th grade) or a copy of a document stating that he graduated from a secondary special, vocational educational institution);</li> <li>A copy of a passport or birth certificate.</li> </ul> <p><strong>A reference from the place of study will be requested in future years, not this year</strong></p> <p>The requirement that the applicant bring a reference from the school, college or lyceum he attended is a social caused discussions in the networks.</p> <p>Kun.uz addressed these and other questions related to the grant to the Ministry of Neighborhood and Family Support.</p> <p>According to the Ministry, the requirement for the applicant to submit a reference letter was approved by the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers on June 23 "Participation of women in the competition within the parameters of admission to higher education institutions based on additional state grants" "On the procedure for issuing a recommendation letter and organizing their admission to study" is specified in the regulation.</p> <p>"However, this requirement in the regulation is not valid for the current year. The reason is that recommendation letters for granting additional grants to girls will be issued in an accelerated format this year.</p> <p>In the following years, women who apply for a recommendation letter must submit their documents to the regional administrations within the time limits set by the regulations. Therefore, it is correct to ask them for a certificate indicating where they will receive their education.</p> <p>Applicants who have completed their studies in previous years should have a document stating that they have completed general secondary education (on the basis of 11th grade) or secondary special vocational education institution in accordance with the Regulations, and submit a copy to the working group along with other documents in accordance with the criteria, he said. The Ministry of Community and Family Support.</p> <p>Representatives of the Ministry noted that this year, the acceptance of recommendations for grants began after graduates graduated from educational institutions, which means that everyone has a certificate of completion of education in their hands, and it is enough for female applicants with a certificate of completion of education to submit a copy of the certificate of completion of school, college or high school. </p> <p><strong>Where do women get documents confirming that they meet the requirements?</strong></p> <p><u>List of women from low-income families</u> The conclusion of the special commission established in accordance with the Regulation "On the procedure for appointing and paying social allowances and financial assistance to low-income families" attached to the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers dated February 15, 2013 and It is determined on the basis of the document.</p> <p><u>The status of women raised in a single-parent family, i.e. women whose father or mother has died</u> is determined on the basis of copies of the death certificates of the father or mother or both. This document can also be requested by the working group independently from the registry office through electronic interdepartmental cooperation.</p> <p><u>The status of daughters of single women (men) raising two or more children under the age of 14 and living separately from other relatives</u> will be determined by the neighborhoods, and the working group can investigate whether they have been correctly assessed. The working group can independently request documents about them from the civil registry authorities.</p> <p><u>Girls from families living in rent without a private home</u> will submit a certificate issued by the state service centers in the name of the applicant's parents (guardian or guardian) confirming the absence of a home or a rental agreement registered by the tax authorities. In this case, the term of the lease agreement must not be less than 1 year.</p> <p><u>Information about those who have one or both parents who are unemployed and are registered in employment assistance centers as job seekers</u> is determined based on the information available in district (city) Employment Assistance Centers.</p> <p><u>Women from families with children with disabilities</u> family they must attach a document confirming that their members have a disability.</p> <p><u>Remote and hard-to-reach areas are: Qonlikol, Moynaq and Shumanay districts of Karakalpakstan; Farish district of Jizzakh region; Dehkanabad district of Kashkadarya region; Tomdi and Uchkuduq districts of Navoi region; Sokh district of Fergana region. <em>(The basis: "Instruction on the procedure for including settlements in hard-to-reach and mountainous regions")</em></u></p> <p><u>According to the statistics of the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education,</u> coverage of women with higher education in the republic is 46 percent. Taking this into account, the working group will consider the issue of issuing recommendations to women who have submitted documents based on this requirement.</p> <p>We understand that the list of districts where the coverage level of women with higher education is two or more times lower than the average indicators of the republic has not yet been approved.</p> <p><strong>The number of recommendations is not limited, but the number of grants is limited</strong></p> <p>According to the Ministry, letters of recommendation will be delivered to women who are applicants for additional grants and meet the requirements by July 15.</p> <p>It should be noted that the number of letters of recommendation to women found to meet the requirements by the working group is not limited. That is, a letter of recommendation can be given to all applicants who meet all the requirements. However, the number of grants is limited: a total of 940 across the republic.</p> <p><strong>The places are distributed as follows:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Samarkand region - 104</li> <li>Fergana region - 100</li> <li>Kashkadarya region - 88</li> <li>Andijan region - 85</li> <li>Tashkent region - 80</li> <li>Namangan region - 75</li> <li>Surkhandarya region - 71</li> <li>Tashkent city - 70</li> <li>Khorazm region - 50</li> <li>Bukhara region - 53</li> <li>Republic of Karakalpakstan - 51</li> <li>Syrdarya region - 49</li> <li>Jizzakh region - 36</li> <li>Navoi region - 28</li> </ul> <p><strong>It is not possible to submit a document from the place of temporary residence</strong></p> <p>Documents are submitted to the district (city) neighborhood and family support departments of the permanent place of residence of women.</p> <p>Girls cannot submit an application for a grant based on the place of temporary residence.</p> <p><strong>Those who did not receive a recommendation will be given an explanation</strong></p> <p>Recommendations will be delivered to applicants by July 15.</p> <p>Women who applied to working groups in district (city) neighborhood and family support departments, but were not given a recommendation, will be given an explanation as to why they were not given a recommendation. will not miss the admission deadline by waiting.</p> <p><strong>Girls with recommendations will also take part in the exam</strong></p> <p>The Ministry will submit the final list of applicants with recommendations to the State Test Center by July 20, 2020.</p> <p>Admission of applicants with recommendations within the framework of additional admission criteria entrance exams (tests, professional (creative) exam, written exam). Those who get enough points are recommended to the student within the admission parameters based on the additional 4% of the state grant based on the sequence of points.</p> <p><strong>During the pandemic, documents are requested in paper form, not online. Why?</strong></p> <p>The Ministry of Neighborhood and Family Support emphasized that it is not allowed to ask women for additional documents when issuing recommendations. The Ministry informs that appropriate measures will be taken to transfer these processes to a fully online format in the future.</p> <p>In order to receive a recommendation letter, the Ministry will examine the documents of applicants in detail, and will take all appropriate measures to prevent candidates who do not meet the criteria and requirements specified in the regulations from being included in this list," the Ministry informed Kun.uz.</p> <p>It is natural that there will be shortcomings due to the fact that the recommendation system is new and is being put into practice in a very short period of time this year. Because of this, the Ministry of Neighborhood and Family Support expressed its readiness to constantly answer the questions that people have, and to eliminate the shortcomings. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oqishni-kochirish-boyicha-ayrim-savollarga-javoblar" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p></strong>
