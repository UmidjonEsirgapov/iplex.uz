                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Forget all the fears and excitements and try to cheer up.</strong><br/><strong>Imagine that the new school year has started and you are the student of your dreams.</strong><br/><strong>Because these foods will pamper you on the day of the exam. possible.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Dear applicant! After a few days, the moment you've been waiting for, the state exam that summarizes the results of your years of knowledge will begin. It's no secret that one of the most exciting moments in our lives is taking college entrance exams.</p> <p><img alt="Igra v disser" src="https://nvdaily.ru/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/student_taking_a_college_exam.jpg"/></p> <p>Today we will give you important recommendations to overcome these emotions and lead to studenthood. we will pass:</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Before the exam</strong></p> <hr> <p><strong>1. Relax a day before the exam. </strong>Relax yourself with all your books. Try to spend your day meaningfully in the park, in the company of your friends.</p> <p><strong>2. Forget about all the doubts.</strong> "Will I be able to achieve my dream and goal?", "What if I don't know difficult questions?", "What if I fail the exam?" remove negative thoughts such as What a man can do, a man does. When so many applicants are students, why can't you be?!</p> <p><strong>3. Cheer up.</strong> Forget all the fears and excitement and try to cheer yourself up. Make jokes with friends. Watch uplifting movies. Listen to your favorite music. Another simple way to cheer up is to play games with the kids. Believe me, innocent childhood games will help you forget all your fears and boost your mood.</p> <p><strong>4. Confidence is half the battle. Believe in yourself. Convince yourself that you will definitely become a student. Imagine that the new academic year has begun and you are the student you have always dreamed of. Feel that you are surrounded by coursework and assignments.</strong></p> <p><strong>5. Pay attention to your diet.</strong> Pay more attention to your diet the day before the exam and on the day of the exam. It is better not to eat coffee and sweets as much as possible. It is also not recommended to eat fried and fatty foods. Because these foods can make you hungry on the exam day.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>During the exam</strong></p> <hr/> <p><strong>1. Go through the question paper. </strong>First, look at the questions on the paper one by one. If there is a flaw in the questions, for example, if the number of options in the given answers is small, then it will be possible to solve the problem at the same time. The staff monitoring the test process can change the question paper. After the names and options of applicants are entered in the register, the question paper will not be changed.</p> <p><strong>2. Manage your time wisely. </strong>Allocate your time properly during the test. First, in the sequence of high-scoring blocks, mark the answers to the questions you know for sure on a piece of paper. Leave the marking on the answer sheet until the end of the test process. When you can't find the answer to one question, don't stop and move on to the next question. Because time is limited.</p> <p><strong>3. Do not rush. </strong>If you are taking a test in specific subjects, after completing the task, compare all the options with your answer. Because the answers are structured in such a way that even a single sign in front of the number can cause you to mark your answer incorrectly.</p> <p><strong>4. Don't pay attention to anyone. </strong>During the test, do not pay attention to the surrounding applicants. Sometimes the applicants who take the test with their heads up and write all the pictures may seem very "knowledgeable" in your eyes. This situation is going to give you a mental shock.</p> <p><strong>5. Be careful while marking on the answer sheet. </strong>When you have marked all the answers on the extra sheet of paper, go over it again. Start marking the answers on the answer sheet 20-30 minutes before the end of the test process. Do not forget that even 0.1 points are very important. Therefore, be careful when marking, check the boxes that can be marked for each subject in its own section.</p> <p><strong>Good luck to you all! May you successfully pass the exam and become a student of your dreams! </strong></p> <p><em><strong>Komiljon Aslanov</strong></em> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/registon-talim-granti-talim-uchun-5-milliard-somlik-grant-loyihasi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.</hr>.
