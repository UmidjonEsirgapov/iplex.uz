Visualization and Mapping</h3> <p><strong>Represent what you've learned using Mind Maps</strong>, diagrams, or tables:</p> <ul> <li> <p>This method presents complex information in a simple and understandable way.</p> </li> <li> <p>Helps you see the connections between ideas.</p> </li> <li> <p>Visual representations help the brain easy to remember for.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>5. Repetition and practice</h3> <p><strong>Repetition is the main factor that strengthens knowledge.</strong> It is not enough to read a book once:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Repeat the main points every week.</p> </li> <li> <p>Think about how you can apply what you have learned in real life.</p> </li> <li> <p>Express your thoughts in writing or orally.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Reading is a great way to sharpen your mind and broaden your horizons. But in order to <strong>remember the knowledge read and be able to use it</strong>, it is necessary to constantly apply the above 5 recommendations. By actively reading, taking notes, discussing, visualizing and revising, you will get the most out of every book you read. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ikkinchi-va-undan-keyingi-ikkinchi-mutaxassislik-talimga-hujjat-topshirish-har-yili-10-iyuldan-boshlanadi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources.
