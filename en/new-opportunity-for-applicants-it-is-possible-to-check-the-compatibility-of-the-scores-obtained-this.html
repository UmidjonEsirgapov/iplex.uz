                The latest news in education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Convenience for applicants: Compare your scores with last year's passing scores Introducing a new feature One of the most frequently asked questions among applicants is "Which course can I get into with my score?" was the question.</strong><br/><strong>Through this opportunity, the applicant can compare his/her points scored in the current year with the passing scores of 2024 and have an approximate goal.</strong><br/><strong>In this system, the results are marked with the following colors: 🟢 Green color - there is a high probability of admission to study on the basis of a contract.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Convenience for applicants: Scored points compare with last year's passing scores</h2> <h3>Introduction of new function</h3> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/7/1100__et2Av_sjXIewrY5_3eDxFWNun40c_Auj.png"/></p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/7/1100__JppYWv5R10ZyvArLvHFBCY2n1Zrdz-sY.png"/></p> <p>One of the most frequently asked questions among applicants was <em>"Which course can I enter with my score?" Now there is an easy way to find a more accurate answer to this.</em></p> <p><strong>Mandat.uzbmb.uz</strong> has added a new, useful function. Through this opportunity, the applicant can compare his/her points scored this year with the passing scores of 2024 and get an approximate goal. How does it work? To use it, do the following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Enter the <strong>ID number</strong> from your permit (not the ID card number!).</p> </li> <li> <p>Your information will be displayed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Based on your current score, a list of destinations you could access last year will appear.</p> </li> <li> <p>Results It is possible to <strong>filter</strong> in <strong>area</strong> and <strong>direction</strong> section.</p> </li> </ol> <h3>What do the colors mean?</h3> <p>In this system, the results are marked with the following colors:</p> <ul> <li> <p> 🟢 <strong>Green color</strong> – high probability of admission to study based on the contract.</p> </li> <li> <p> 🟡 <strong>Yellow color</strong> – not enough points for the contract.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Important note</h3> <p>This year's passing points are still unknown. They will be clear only <strong>after the announcement of mandates</strong>. Therefore, the information obtained through this function serves only as an <strong>approximate target</strong>.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p><strong>The new function added to the <p><strong>mandat.uzbmb.uz</strong> site will greatly help applicants in roughly estimating their opportunities. This helps to make a reliable decision, especially when <strong>choosing a direction</strong>. We encourage all applicants to use this tool. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/imtihonsiz-qoshimcha-davlat-granti-asosida-talabalikka-tavsiya-etish-uchun-asos-boluvchi-imtiyozlar" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Stay tuned for other educational news.</strong></p>
