                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>What do you want your life to be?</strong><br/><strong>If you have a lot of dreams, if they all belong to you personally, and if you believe that they will come true, then you will have satisfaction and happiness in life.</strong><br/><strong>All other things are secondary things. and a person is absolutely not obliged to do these things.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Many people look at the concept of "luck" as some kind of random and unpredictable concept. In fact, most of the world's experts have found the reason why a person is lucky or unlucky and proved it from a scientific point of view. After studying the lives of several thousand lucky people, the experts found out that they have a common outlook and even actions. They proved that this commonality is the feeling that a lucky person should have. Also, experts have witnessed that unlucky, unhappy, poor and sick people do not have these feelings at all.</p> <p>The most basic feelings that a lucky, happy, healthy and rich person should have are listed below one by one:</p> <p></p> <p><strong>1. What do you want?<img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/4/1100__jh_8GHwrkURXQJwo3554TjN0SEythlR-.jpg"/></strong><strong></strong></p> <p>What do you want your life to be? Many people say that they want to be lucky and happy. But these words mean nothing. Because luck and happiness will not come until a person determines for himself how to achieve results in each area of ​​his life. In short, if you don't know what you want, God doesn't know what you want, and he doesn't know what to give you. Many people think that I should ask for happiness and luck, that Allah will know and give me what I need. However, according to experience, people whose lives are enviable in 8 areas (family, money, health, etc.) always keep in mind what they want to achieve in each area.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>2. Your life should please you. <img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/4/1100__sfHRBAO0h6-HLavWkPRpDQOILtNVdIK_.jpeg"/></strong></p> <p>Rate how satisfied you are with your life according to the 10-point evaluation system.</p> <p>10 is an unattainable ideal, 8-9 is an ideal state that can be reached. 1-7 is a bad situation.</p> <p>If your score is in the range of 1-7, then you should immediately roll up your sleeves and try to change your life for the better.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>3. A dream - your goals should make you happy. They are intentions that have been instilled in the brain by people around you (parents, teachers, friends, etc.).</strong></p> <p>If you don't feel happy when you imagine that your intention has come true right now, that is, if you don't feel happy feelings like "I wish this thing would come true, it would be great, I really want it to happen," then that intention is not yours. That is, it is not a dream that comes from your heart and belongs to you.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>4. You should enjoy life.<img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/4/1100__E4he3MaPycjzgJl6Uu04TrMH22owHZIZ.jpg"/></strong></p> <p>No one knows what makes you happy except yourself. Learn to enjoy the little things in your life. Do not count the number of negative events in your life, but count the number of things that have ended successfully, and thank the one who created them every time. It doesn't have to be a big happy event for this. You should learn to enjoy fresh air, beautiful nature, the food you eat, the work you do, or any other small thing.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>5. Laugh!<img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/4/1100__0RqJg6v-2xyoBELSFQX3Eyy-zG-kZ3FS.jpg"/></strong></p> <p>The connection between laughter and luck can be called a divine phenomenon. But everyone likes a person who always laughs in life, comes to him, wants to talk, and such people cheer everyone up. That is why such a person is more likely to achieve his goal, make the necessary acquaintances, gather like-minded people around him, agree with those around him, and get people's support.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p><strong>6. You should have many dreams and goals.</strong></p> <p>The more the number of intentions, the faster they will come true. Many people dream of something, and when they think of a way to achieve it, they give up on this intention, saying, "Rosa, it's difficult, there's so much to do." He says no. But you should never do this. You don't have to think about the way to achieve it at the beginning, you just have to keep wanting that intention and God will guide you and your intention will come true.</p> <p>If you have a lot of dreams, if they all belong to you personally and you believe that they will come true, then as a result you will have satisfaction and happiness in life. A person who lives happily in life will certainly become a lucky and happy person. He will be lucky in every field and his dreams will come true quickly, easily and without any difficulties.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p><strong>7. Dreams and intentions should be chosen not through the head, but through the body (Xa reflex). So listen to yourself. Check your dreams: stand up, close your eyes and put your hand on your chest. Imagine the image of your dreams. How your body responds to that intention. If you feel inner joy, increased energy, and your body saying, "Ha…Ha…I want this!" If he says, it means that this is your original intention from your heart. Otherwise, these intentions are dreams and desires that have been instilled in your mind by others. The positive response of your body to the image you think is called "Xa reflex".</strong></p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p><strong>8. It is impossible to wish hard.</strong></p> <p>This is the law of life. The more you want something, the less likely you are to make it happen. In order for this not to happen, there must be a large number of intentions. If the number of intentions is more than 100, a person will not be so worried about any of them. Because all the energy and attention of a person is divided into those 100 intentions.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p><strong>9. Life is a playground.</strong></p> <p>Learn to take life lightly. Any event, event or object that does not threaten your life is given to you so that you can enjoy life, develop, express yourself and "play" in different roles. All events in life should be treated as a game. If you don't like the game you're playing, you have the option to end it and start another one.</p> <p>Taking the minutiae of daily life seriously can lead to stress, fatigue, depression, and other mental problems. Most people do not know the difference between their important work and secondary work, and they complain to everyone about how difficult life is. Life-important work is work aimed at ensuring human survival and safety on earth. For example, feeding the body with necessary nutrients, maintaining health, treating diseases, providing safe living conditions, eliminating factors that threaten human life, and so on. In short, if one does not do these things for a certain period of time, it is certain that a person will die. Everyone has to do these things. All the other jobs are secondary jobs, and a person is not obliged to do them at all. That is, a person should look at these things like a game. For example, the game of marriage, the game of raising a child, the game of earning more money and hokozo.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p><strong>10. Never do just one thing.</strong></p> <p>Always kill two birds with one stone at every turn. Try to fulfill at least 2 of your intentions at the same time. Then your intentions will quickly come true, and this in turn will make your life more joyful, lucky and happy. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qozogistondagi-2-ta-otm-litsenziyasi-toxtatildi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources..
