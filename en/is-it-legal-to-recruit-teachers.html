Therefore, <strong>employer's forcing teachers to be on duty does not have a legal basis</strong>.</p> <p><strong>According to Article 115 of the Labor Code</strong>, the employer has no right to demand from the employee to perform work that is not specified in the employment contract. Also, the employer cannot require the employee to perform actions that are against the law or violate the rights of the employee.</p> <p>In such cases, according to <strong>Article 49</strong> of the Code of Administrative Responsibility, <strong>an official</strong> may be fined for violating labor laws. For this reason, <strong>it is illegal</strong> to attract teachers to school duty. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/bu-umuman-talimni-tushunmaydigan-insonning-gapi-oliy-talim-vaziri-tandidga-uchradi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
