                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Several methods can be used to keep reading in memory.</strong><br/><strong>If the received information is not processed in the first 20 minutes, it is highly likely that this information will not be retained in memory.</strong><br/><strong>The brain remembers the information received before sleep well. </strong><br/><hr/> <h4>Reading is useful, it is doubly useful if the information obtained is retained in memory and applied in practice.</h4> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/6/RWJwsjLbaq6Q-2CMYWc616aezCq3uNau.jpg"/></p> <p>But read (especially scientific-popular, It is difficult to remember information when reading a non-fiction book. This is a natural process and not a distraction. Several methods can be used to keep the reading in memory.</p> <p><strong>In the process of direct reading</strong></p> <p>After every 20 minutes of reading, pause and ask yourself "what did I understand from what I read?" the question must be answered. You can go over the most important points in your mind, and if possible, put a mark in the margin of the book.</p> <p>Why exactly in 20 minutes? German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus studied the process of human memory retention. According to research, a person forgets 40% of the received information in the first 20 minutes, and 60% in 1 hour. And after a day, only 33-35 percent of the information is retained.</p> <p>If the received information is not processed in the first 20 minutes, there is a high probability that this information will not be retained in the memory.</p> <p>It has been proven in research that retelling is more effective than rereading, so that the information is better imprinted in the memory. Because when speaking, the brain tries to associate information with other situations/information. It is not only received, but processed.</p> <p>After completing the first day of reading, write down the most important points of the information you read. It will be more convenient and interesting if it is not in the form of a dry synopsis, but in the form of an intellectual map. The brain remembers well the information received before sleep.</p> <p><strong>The next days of reading</strong></p> <p>In this case, the algorithm used in TV series can be used. That is, before starting a new series of the series, what happened in yesterday's series will be shown with short clips. For this purpose, it may be useful to look at the symbols and names of sections.</p> <p><strong>After reading</strong></p> <p>It is necessary to start applying the information received as soon as possible.</p> <p>If it is not possible to apply them in practice, but it is important to retain the information, it is useless to hold the book and repeat it at certain intervals. It won't happen. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/1-avgustdan-talabalar-turar-joyiga-joylashish-uchun-ariza-berish-boshlanadi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
