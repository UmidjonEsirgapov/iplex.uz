I really enjoy spending time outside, especially when the weather is pleasant. I often go to the park near my home to play badminton, which is my favorite outdoor activity. It helps me stay active and reduces stress.</p> <h3><strong>Question: What outdoor sports do you like?</strong></h3> <p><strong>Answer:</strong>I like playing badminton and football.

I also enjoy jogging in the morning to refresh my mind.</p> <h3><strong>Question: How much time do you spend outdoors every week?</strong></h3> <p><strong>Answer:</strong>I try to spend at least an hour outdoors every day. On weekends, I usually go for a long walk or play sports with my friends. However, during busy workdays, I may not have much time for outdoor activities.</p> <h2><strong>Part 2: Thematic speech and detailed answers</strong></h2> <h3><strong>Question: Describe a teacher who has influenced you in your education.</strong></h3> <p><strong>Answer:</strong>One of the most influential teachers in my life was my high school mathematics teacher, Mr. Smith. At first, I thought he was very strict, but later I realized that his teaching methods were effective. He always explained complex topics in a simple way and encouraged us to think critically. Thanks to his support, I developed a strong interest in mathematics, which later became my favorite subject.</p> <h3><strong>Question: Describe a popular product in your country.</strong></h3> <p><strong>Answer:</strong>One of the most popular products in my country is traditional handmade ceramics.
