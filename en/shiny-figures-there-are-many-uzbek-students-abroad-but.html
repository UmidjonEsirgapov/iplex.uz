                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>According to the 2021 UNESCO report on students studying abroad, 109,945 Uzbeks are studying abroad.</strong><br/><strong>The 2022 report of the Ministry of Education and Science of Kyrgyzstan According to the data of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia, the number of Uzbek students studying in this country in 2023 is 48,700. <br/> But studying abroad has become an "innovative" way for the majority of young Uzbeks to transfer their studies to Uzbekistan after a certain period of time or to get a diploma. <p>According to the 2021 UNESCO report on students studying abroad, 109,945 Uzbeks are studying abroad. Of course, these numbers are pleasing to the eye and give some hopeful feelings. But if the situation is analyzed in depth, it can be seen that there are serious problems in this regard.</p> <p><strong>Why has the number of Uzbeks studying abroad increased dramatically?</strong></p> <p>The number of Uzbek students studying abroad was 28,100 in 2015, and 32,900 in 2016. Between 2015 and 2021, their number increased almost 4 times. This may have been influenced by the following factors.</p> <p><strong>Firstly</strong>, for many years there was a huge imbalance between the demand and supply in higher education. For example, in the 2015/2016 academic year, 57,907<strong> </strong>students were <u>admitted</u> to the bachelor's education course (for comparison, 193,421 applicants were <u>recommended</u> for studentship in the 2023/2024 academic year). During this period, the level of coverage of the population of student age with higher education did not exceed 9%, the financing of the sector from the state treasury was only 0.4% of the country's gross domestic product. This was one of the worst indicators in the world.</p> <p>As a result, there was a large "army of applicants" who did not enter the university for 4-5 years, and their number was increasing every year. Against the background of the change of government, the improvement of relations with neighboring and sister countries, the relative simplification of the transfer of studies and the recognition of diplomas obtained abroad will encourage tens of thousands of young people, primarily from bordering countries and post-Soviet countries, to higher education institutions. src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/10/Ss3QZNbKe1LA-j5y6kB6kRd8jVMr189A.jpg". For this purpose, in 2018, the "Hope of El-Yurt" fund was <u>created</u>. That is, the desire to get a quality education, the increase in the income of the population in recent years, and the bilateral relations established with international universities have encouraged the increase in the number of students studying abroad. Exemption from tests for students with national or international foreign language certificates also supported this. In this regard, most of the young people have mobilized and prefer to study in foreign universities that provide better education and better opportunities than studying at HEIs in Uzbekistan. </p> <p><strong>In which countries are Uzbeks studying? passed. Well, in which countries are these students studying.</strong></p> <p>According to the data of the Ministry of Education and Science of Kyrgyzstan in 2022, 38 thousand 857 Uzbek students studied in higher education institutions of the country, and in 2023 this number <u>reached</u> 40 282.</p> <p>The number of Uzbek students studying in Kazakhstan was 14,235 in 2020, and this number decreased to 9,571 in 2022. The decrease in the number of students studying in Kazakhstan can be explained by the fact that in 2020, by the decision of the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education, Uzbeks studying in neighboring countries were allowed to enter local higher educational institutions without additional exams. At that time, most of the "perevod" were carried out from Kazakhstan.</p> <p>According to the data of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science, the number of Uzbek students studying in this country in 2023 was 48,700. It is known that in recent years, joint educational programs with Russian higher education institutions have been increasing (in many of them, half of the studies are planned to be continued in Russia).</p> <p>Also, in 2023, more than 12,000 Uzbek students <u>studied</u> in South Korea, and more than 5,000 students at Tajikistan higher education institutions.</p> <p><strong>What is the problem?</strong></p> <p>Approximately more than 90 percent of Uzbek students studying abroad study in countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia and South Korea. What attracts Uzbek youth so much to study in these countries? Here is the most important aspect of the matter.</p> <p>In recent years, you may have come across advertisements distributed by consulting firms with the following content: "Become a student in a neighboring country without an exam, study in Uzbekistan from the 2nd level without problems", "You can finish the 1st year without going once." That is, some educational institutions in Kyrgyzstan or Kazakhstan where Uzbek students attend are "universities" engaged in selling diplomas. The quality of education in them is worse than in Uzbekistan, and students are treated as "food" for 4 years. Because after the end of the study period, the Uzbek student does not take on the social responsibility of getting a job, becoming a specialist in a certain field. The main goal for them is to get a visa, and for this reason, many of those who leave do not complete their studies.</p> <p>True, the number of young people going to study abroad is increasing year by year against the background of the quality of the education system of Uzbekistan. For example, last year, the number of Uzbek students studying in the United States increased by 1,000. This is a unique new record indicator. But the majority of those who went to study in neighboring republics and former post-Soviet countries had 2 goals - to transfer their studies to Uzbekistan after a certain period of time (although admission to study in Uzbekistan has become easier in recent years, strong competition remains in the fields of medicine or law) or to obtain a diploma.</p> <p><strong>Doston Ahrorov</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/4/4-sinf-rus-tili" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>How will this news affect you? did?
