We waited until August 21, but the results did not come out. In the middle of the night there was a noise, and when I opened my eyes, they said, "We have entered the study." I still didn't believe it. After seeing the results with my own eyes, I believed... (my passion) is hard to explain. It is a great happiness for parents that their child is enrolled in a grant, I hope that every parent will feel this," said Sanjar Yusupov.</blockquote> <p>According to the words of the housewife Shahlo Yusupova, the investment spent on the children's future always pays off. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/fargona-jamoat-salomatligi-tibbiyot-instituti-tashkil-etilmoqda" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <blockquote>"It was not easy to get to these days, it took a lot of hard work, thank God for these days. we have reached The money spent and invested for the child's education and future always pays off," he said.</blockquote> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.</p>
