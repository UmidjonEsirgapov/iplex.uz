                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>But with students it is also a kind of nightmare.</strong><br/><strong>Suppose 4 people live on 300 dollars, that 300 is usually collected half-assed or in arrears.</strong><br/><strong>Utility bills also accumulate and After them, there will definitely be debt.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>It is known from experience that students, especially young men, never fulfill agreements. The most common situation is that 4 people say they are staying, but 6-7, sometimes 10 people leave. They try to deceive the owner of the house who came to check that he is a guest;</p> <p>The purpose of renting is to make a profit. But with students, this is also a unique problem. Let's say 4 people live on $300, and that $300 is usually half-assed or in arrears. If you look for it, two of them will come out and give their 150 dollars (if they give it). You can't demand from the one who doesn't, you can't say anything to the one who gives, because he is giving. </p> <p>Utility bills also accumulate, and after them, debt will certainly remain. It is considered natural to repair the house;</p> <p>Cleanliness is a separate issue! In recent years, not only boys, but even girls have almost completely forgotten about blonde hair. When you see them walking and dressing up on the street, you feel envious. But you will be nervous right from the threshold of the rental house. The shoes and socks are smelly, a week's worth of garbage has accumulated, the gutters have run over, and the house is untidy. There will be a working category. Due to fatigue, they don't even find it necessary to get up from bed to ask;</p> <p>Problems do not remain within the household. Of course, the neighbors will be disturbed, complaints will be made. The police are also ready. </p> <p>These are the opinions of a person who finds rental houses for students. </p> <p>Send it to your friends who are students who live on rent. Maybe if the mistakes here happened to them, they will correct them. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ingliz-tilini-mustaqil-organish-uchun-eng-yaxshi-manbalar" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.
