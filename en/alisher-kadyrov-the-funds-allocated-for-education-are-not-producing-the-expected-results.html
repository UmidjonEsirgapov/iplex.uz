                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>In the discussions, Alisher Kadyrov, the head of the UzMTDP faction, specifically focused on the education sector and noted that the funds allocated to this system are not producing the expected results: - It is gratifying that the funds allocated to the education system have increased by almost 3 times. </strong><br/><strong>35 trillion soums are being allocated for their monthly expenses.</strong><br/><strong>We need to direct a certain part of the 35 trillion money to MTT.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>In today's meeting of the Legislative Chamber of the Supreme Assembly, the implementation of the State Program for the nine months of 2023 and "<strong>State Budget of the Republic of Uzbekistan for 2024 The bill on</strong>" was heatedly discussed.</p> <p>During the discussions, Alisher Kadyrov, the head of the UzMTDP faction, focused on the field of education and emphasized that the funds allocated to this system are not producing the expected results: </p> <p>- It is gratifying that the funds allocated to the education system <strong>have been increased by almost 3 times case</strong>. But it is necessary to improve the efficiency of these allocated funds. </p> <p>In the next year's budget, 80 percent of the funds allocated to the Ministry of Preschool and School Education will be allocated for teachers' salaries. A teacher should really get a higher salary. Because they create the future. We have recently adopted the law on the status of pedagogues, which defines the status and legal protection of teachers. </p> <p>Budget funds for the sector are not decreasing. But the current conditions do not inspire new hopes for the future. In other words, the funds given to education are not producing the expected results. Last year, about 50 percent of the applicants who applied to higher education institutions did not even show a result worthy of 2 marks. </p> <p>Today there are about 500 thousand teachers. 35 trillion soums are allocated for their monthly expenses. According to the analysis, 10-15 percent of redundant teachers are working in schools. </p> <p>Time has sped up so much that today, a student can get information on the Internet that a teacher prepares for several days. Therefore, the pedagogue must adapt to the times and be modern. Our proposal is that the ministry should seriously think about the effectiveness of the investments directed to education. Along with improving the qualifications of teachers, it is necessary to create a system of correct evaluation of their work based on the requirements of the times. </p> <p>We should direct a certain part of the 35 trillion to MTT. The situation in kindergartens is not good either. There is one teacher for every 30-35 children. Only 25-30 percent of teachers with higher education in the system. It is necessary to increase the salaries of kindergarten teachers. In accordance with world standards, we should think about attaching one tutor to 10-15 children, - said Alisher Kadyrov.  — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qabul-2025-abituriyentlar-bilishi-shart-bolgan-5-ta-muhim-fakt" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
