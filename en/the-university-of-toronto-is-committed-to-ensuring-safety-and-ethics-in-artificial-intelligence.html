                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>The University of Toronto is taking cutting-edge approaches in research and education on how to adapt artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to human values.</strong><br/><strong>The university's Schwarz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society promotes technologies in the public interest through initiatives dedicated to the ethical and safe regulation of artificial intelligence. </strong><br/><strong>David Lee, director of the institute, said, "It will take a lot of people to properly manage and control artificial intelligence, and we need to act now." Ethics Education Initiative The University of Toronto is implementing an Ethics Education Initiative to ensure deep learning of ethical principles among students.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>What steps is the University of Toronto taking for a safer and more ethical AI?</strong></p> <p>The University of Toronto is taking cutting-edge approaches in research and education to align artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with human values. The university's Schwarz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society seeks to create technologies that are in the public interest through initiatives dedicated to the ethical and safe regulation of artificial intelligence.</p> <p>The University of Toronto is known for its work in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning by Jeffrey Hinton and his students. Currently, the rapid growth in the field of AI is increasing the need for its regulation, which makes the University of Toronto a leader in the process of creating safe and ethical AI technologies. This includes fields such as computer science, law, public policy, philosophy, and psychology. David Lee, the institute's director, said that <strong>“many people will be needed to properly manage and control artificial intelligence, and we need to act now.”</strong></p> <h3><strong>Ethics Education Initiative</strong></h3> <p>The University of Toronto is implementing an <strong>Ethics Education Initiative</strong> to ensure deep learning of ethical principles among students. Through this program, students learn to develop technologies in accordance with human values. Professor Sheila McElraith says: "Ethical considerations must become an integral part of design principles. This process requires the development of ethical sensitivity in students entering the workforce." More than 8,000 students are currently enrolled in computer science and ethics courses.</p> <h3><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Legal Implications</strong></h3> <p>The University of Toronto has launched a new course, <strong>Digital Privacy and Privacy Regulation</strong>. This course allows law and engineering students to study artificial intelligence technologies and their legal implications together.</p> <blockquote> <p>David Lee defines the main goal of the institute as the <strong>development of artificial intelligence in a safe and appropriate way for the benefit of mankind</strong>: <strong>“Given that technology is expanding throughout society, it does not make sense to teach it in isolation. The criterion of success is to create a healthy ecosystem that allows us to live better with artificial intelligence.</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/padua-universiteti-stipendiyalari" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p></blockquote>
