                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Because training centers are now delivering graduates with skills and qualifications that the market requires.</strong><br/><strong>This is not because of a decline in interest, they got the knowledge they wanted at that time and thought that we better continue our startups. </strong><br/><strong>Students start dropping out of universities from the second and third years.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Executive director of the "Boursa National" company, professor Azamat Akbarov emphasized that it is wrong to keep students in the university for four years and proposed to change the universities to 3 years.</p> <p>"One thing must be understood, by 2030 universities will fulfill tasks and goals will change completely. They will change their form. For example, by that time, even ordinary educational centers will be able to supply graduates with the skills and qualifications required by the market. That is, let's say that educational centers teach a person who needs to learn IT in 6 months. When a student sees this situation, he starts to think, "Why do I have to study for 4 years?" They thought that we should continue our startups. Soon, this tradition will reach us. We live in a knowledge-based society. Now the poles are changing," said Azamat Akbarov. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/chin-yetimlar-uchun-qoshimcha-kvotadan-qancha-davlat-granti-ajratiladi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p>
