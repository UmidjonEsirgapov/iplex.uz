                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>In 1979, a remarkable study is conducted at Harvard University.</strong><br/><strong>All MBA graduates are asked the following question: "Do you have a specific goal in life that you always strive for?" The answers were as follows: 84% of graduates said that they did not have a goal.</strong><br/><strong>13% of graduates could state their goals, but did not have a clear strategy or plan to achieve them.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>In 1979, a remarkable study was conducted at Harvard University. All MBA graduates are asked the following question:</p> <ul> <li>"Do you have a specific goal in life that you always strive for?"</li> </ul> <p>The answers were as follows:</p> <ul> <li><strong>84%</strong> of the graduates said they did not have a goal.</li> <li><strong>13%</strong> of the graduates were able to state their goals, but they did not have a clear strategy or plan to achieve them.</li> <li><strong>3%</strong> of the graduates admitted that they have a goal that drives them and, unlike others, they wrote down and made a clear strategy or plan to achieve it.</li> </ul> <p>Later, the researchers followed their lives for 10 years and came to the following interesting conclusion:</p> <ul> <li><strong>13%</strong> of the graduates with a vision of a goal are surfing. Compared to <strong>84%</strong>, they were 2 times more successful in life.</li> <li><strong>3%</strong> who wrote down a goal and strived towards it every day were 10 times more successful than <strong>97%</strong> graduates.</li> </ul> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>If a person sets a goal during his life and strives for it, he will use his hidden potential. It can be used 10-20 times more effectively. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/2025-yildan-pensiyalar-avtomatik-tayinlanadi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.
