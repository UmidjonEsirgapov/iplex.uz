                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Simply speaking, if someone entered the grant through an additional quota, he is considered to have received an IRG.</strong><br/><strong>Through the additional quota, TM graduates also have the opportunity to study on the basis of a state grant in their special field, without prejudice to other applicants. </strong><br/><strong>Conclusion If the graduates of the "Temurbek School" were accepted as students through the additional quota allocated from the 2024/2025 academic year, they are considered to be the owners of a social incentive grant (IRG).</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>A 4-year grant will be allocated to the graduates of the "Temurbek School"</h2> <h3>What is a social incentive grant (IRG)?</h3> <p>A social incentive grant (IRG) is an educational aid provided in the form of a state grant on the basis of a privilege established by the law, which:</p> <ul> <li> <p>to students admitted as part of a targeted admission,</p> </li> <li> <p>on the basis of grants allocated by state bodies and organizations </p> </li> <li> <p>also applies to those studying on the basis of industry and field grants. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Simply speaking, if someone entered the grant through an additional quota, he is considered to have received IRG. (TM) graduates were given additional points. This caused dissatisfaction among many applicants. After that, this privilege was canceled and instead they were allocated a separate <strong>additional quota</strong>.</p> <p>Through the additional quota, TM graduates also had the opportunity to study on the basis of a state grant in their own special field without disturbing other applicants.</p> <h3>How will the grants be distributed?</h3> <p>Starting from 2025, all students will receive a grant based on the grant. the study period is <strong>redistributed</strong> from year to year. This means that:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Those who have studied well will continue their studies on the basis of a grant;</p> </li> <li> <p>Those with poor study results will be transferred to a payment-contract basis.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>TM graduates are excluded from this system</h3> <p>According to the presidential decree, <strong>Students who have received grants for the full period of study according to the Ministry's explanation and decision, since TM graduates are also holders of IRG, they:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>are given a full state grant for 4 years;</p> </li> <li> <p>It is not necessary to participate in the redistribution of the grant every year.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In other words, they are fully funded on the basis of the grant, without the risk of falling into a contract. studies.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>If the graduates of "Temurbeklar School" have been accepted as students through the additional quota allocated from the 2024/2025 academic year, they are the owners of a social incentive grant (IRG). Therefore, they will be allocated a 4-year grant and will not be included in the annual grant redistribution procedure. This ensures that TM graduates have financial stability during their studies. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/danish-government-scholarship-magistratura-bosqichida-talim-olish-uchun-toliq-grant-va-taxminan-490-aqsh-dollari-miqdorida-oylik-stipendiya" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
