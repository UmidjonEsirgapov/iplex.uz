                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Detailed quotas will be announced by the State Admission Commission.</strong><br/><strong>We should wait for the State Admission Commission to approve the following for the 2024/2025 academic year: General admission parameters (universities, forms of education and languages </strong><br/><strong>For example: 50 grants to TDYU, 25 grants to UzMU, 20 grants to KSU. In this way, instead of saying that the state will give grants to such and such a university, it says that it will give grants to smart applicants who have submitted to a certain course and got high marks. natural. This year's quotas, approved by presidential decree, have several differences from the previous ones: <h4>The main differences of the quotas:</h4> <ol> <li><strong>It was announced in the section of directions:</strong> The quotas were announced not in the section of higher education institutions (OTM), but in the section of directions.</li> <li><strong>It was announced only for the state grant:</strong> The quotas were only for the state grant announced, there are no quotas for fee-contract.</li> <li><strong>Only for full-time education:</strong> Quotas were announced only for full-time education, there are no quotas for part-time, evening and distance education.</li> </ol> <h4>When and by whom will the quotas be announced?</h4> <p>Detailed quotas by the State Admissions Commission will be announced. Usually it takes about 1 more week. After the President approves the general quota, we will have to wait for the detailed quotas again.</p> <h4>What will the State Admission Commission approve?</h4> <p>We should wait for the State Admission Commission to approve the following for the 2024/2025 academic year:</p> <ul> <li>General admission parameters (in terms of universities, forms of education and languages).</li> <li>Additional admission parameters (for applicants with privileges).</li> <li>Targeted admission quotas and the distribution of these quotas in the section of districts (cities).</li> <li>The minimum passing score for admission.</li> <li>The share of the state grant quota compared to the general admission parameter.</li> </ul> <h4>How will the grant quota be distributed in the section of directions?</h4> <p>This year Since then, state grants are allocated not to universities, but to fields. For example, there will be no specific grant quota for Tashkent State Law University (TDYU). Perhaps a general grant quota will be allocated for the field of jurisprudence.</p> <p>In this case, among the applicants who applied to the field of jurisprudence in all universities of the republic, those who scored the highest points within the quota, regardless of which university they applied to, will receive a grant. This means that some universities may no longer have any students who received a grant.</p> <h4>A clear example:</h4> <p>This year, 115 grant quotas were allocated for the field of jurisprudence. Let's say that TDYU, UzMU, QSU, SamSU and NamSU have a jurisprudence course. All applicants to the jurisprudence department of these 5 universities will be evaluated in order of points, and grants will be awarded to 115 applicants with the highest scores. For example:</p> <ul> <li>50 grants to TDYU,</li> <li>25 grants to UzMU,</li> <li>20 grants to QSU</li> </ul> <p>In this way, instead of saying that the state will give grants to such and such a university, it says that it will give grants to smart applicants who apply for a certain course and get high marks. This means that entering a contract with a university with 160 points and entering a grant for the same course with 100 points at another university will disappear.</p> <h4>Restrictions:</h4> <p>Limitations are set so that one university does not take away the entire quota of the state grant. For example, if all 115 quotas correspond to TDYU, a 50% limit is imposed. That is, TDYU can receive only half of the 115 quotas, i.e. 57 grant quotas.</p> <h4>Conclusion:</h4> <p>So far, the quotas have not been fully approved, so it is necessary to wait for the approval of the quotas in the fields of universities, payment contracts, forms of education and languages. This process depends on the State Admission Commission chaired by the Prime Minister. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/garvard-talabalarini-ruhlantirish-uchun-qanday-gaplar-aytilishini-bilasizmi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>This information was obtained from official sources.</strong>
