This is a process that requires the student to be in an educational institution. Part-time study for the master's degree can be considered after learning experiences. But now we don't have the possibility to study magistracy by correspondence. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oliygoh/jamoat-xavfsizligi-universiteti" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <h4>Deputy Minister of Higher and Secondary Special Education Uzokboy Begimkulov</h4> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
