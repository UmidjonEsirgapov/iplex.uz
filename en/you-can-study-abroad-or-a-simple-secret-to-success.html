                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>If you have started to do something, if you have chosen a field as a profession, intend to be the best in this field.</strong><br/><strong>He should not stop searching and learning, but only move forward. get complete information about what colleges or universities are available, what documents are required for admission.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>It is difficult to find someone who does not want to study abroad. Many of our Uzbek compatriots study in prestigious higher educational institutions in different parts of the world. Before we get into the full picture of how they got the opportunity to study here, allow me to digress a bit.</p> <p>When I was in high school in Uzbekistan, we had a math teacher. He was very strict, full of himself, one of the most respected teachers of our lyceum. All of his children have higher education, some of them studied abroad. I envied their family. One day, this teacher said something to me: "Study, my son. Go abroad and study. Whatever you want, you have all the possibilities, you just have to look for it. If I were in your place, hehe, I would travel the world..."</p> <p>More than 10 years have passed since these words were said. Following my teacher's advice, I tried to study seriously and go abroad to see the world. As a student, based on my past years of experience, I was convinced that my teacher was right. Searching, finding opportunities, and certainly achieving his goal...</p> <p>Do you know what is the main difference between you and Bill Gates, the richest man in the United States? The main difference is that he achieved success that others did not. This is the success that made him rich and the founder of the world-famous computer software company Microsoft. What is the key to his success? Can you and we be like him? Don't be too quick to say no. Of course we can. We can be better than him.</p> <p>For example, Elon Musk. This young man, who came to the United States as a student from South Africa, became not only one of the richest people in the United States in a few years, but also became one of the greatest businessmen of the century, revolutionizing a number of industries such as automobiles, space rockets, and solar energy technologies. This guy didn't come to the US with a lot of money or acquaintances. What he has achieved today, he achieved all through his intelligence, hard work and acquired knowledge. Bill Gates and Elon Musk, like others, are two-legged creatures with eyes, nose, and mouth. When he was born, he was a weak baby who didn't know anything, couldn't even hold his head up, just like you were when you were a baby. But study and research, hard work brought him to the peak of today's success...</p> <p>One of our teachers told us: "There are the strongest and best people in every field. When you start doing something, choose a field as a profession, have the intention that I will be the best in this field. Don't say that you will be a good specialist, say that you will be the number one best specialist and go on that way. do your best. Maybe you are destined to be the best in this field, why don't you try? Even if you are not the best, you will be one of the best." I will say.</p> <p>Because that is the real secret of success of Bill Gates or Elon Musk. Because if there is no goal or goal that inspires and motivates a person to move forward, there will be no progress at all. A student means a seeker, a learner. He should not stop searching and learning, but only move forward. If the above words have aroused your enthusiasm, then let's move on to the main topic. You want to study abroad, become an expert in your chosen field, earn an honest living and support your family and serve the people. Congratulations, you have successfully passed the most important, most basic exam of the opportunity to study abroad. Because having the right intention and determination to achieve this intention is the main condition for success. You are now required to do some research and work harder.</p> <p>It is not easy to get into the world's best educational institutions. The demand for quality things will be strong. This means that there are many people who want to study in these educational institutions, and accordingly, the conditions of admission are difficult and the prices of education are expensive. First of all, you need to gather enough information about your chosen field. Get complete information on what colleges or universities offer study in this field, what documents are required for admission. Nowadays, all the information about this can be easily found on the university web pages. In the next step, you need to prepare these documents.</p> <p>As you know, foreign students are required to take special TOEFL or IELTS tests to check their English language proficiency. If you're applying for a master's or graduate program, there are additional tests in the US, such as the GRE or GMAT. You must submit these. Another important aspect of this process is finding grants to cover the cost of your studies. An ordinary Uzbek child like you and me cannot afford to come to America and live or study in these expensive cities. But do not lose hope, because there is a solution. One of the unique advantages of studying abroad is that there are many special programs that offer educational grants if your financial situation does not cover the costs of living and studying here. Usually, each university has special grant programs for students, especially for international students.</p> <p>In addition, there are grant programs that cover all expenses in full or partially for special foreigners or for some countries, for example, from Uzbekistan. For example, the American government has established special educational programs for Uzbeks in more than 15 areas that provide full grants. You can find complete information about this on the website of the US Embassy in Uzbekistan. We will talk about how to prepare documents to win a grant or how to acquire and develop the necessary knowledge and skills that will lead to winning this grant. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ilm-olishda-6-ta-muhim-qoida" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p>
