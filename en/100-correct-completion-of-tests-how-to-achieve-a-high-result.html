                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>By doing this, you will be able to find the questions that are easy for you and identify the questions that are more difficult.</strong><br/><strong>This type of answer is almost always the wrong option, and unless you are really sure that at least two of the above answer options are correct, do not answer such answers. do not mark as correct answer!</strong><br/><strong>Just trust your knowledge!</strong><br/><hr/> <p>The days of entrance exams are still close. On this day, someone trusts in knowledge, someone in luck, and someone in something else, going to the exam building with the dream of completing the entrance exam tests 100% correctly and being lucky as a student. Everyone performs the tests based on their own knowledge, according to their own style. Below I would like to mention the necessary steps that are important for you to perform the tests correctly. If you strictly follow these steps, you will greatly increase your chances of passing the tests 100% correctly. If you want to run the tests completely correctly, follow these steps:</p> <p><strong>1. TRUST YOUR KNOWLEDGE.</strong> This is the first rule! Before taking the test, rely on the knowledge you have acquired until the day of the test. If the applicant believes in himself, in his knowledge, believe that he will be able to accomplish any task he sets before himself. Even if you have knowledge, if you don't believe in yourself, if you start taking the test full of guesses and fears, you may not be able to solve the simple questions positively due to excessive excitement. Believe in yourself and you will succeed!</p> <p><strong>2. GO THROUGH ALL THE QUESTIONS.</strong> Quickly scan through all the questions in the question book before you begin. By doing this, you will be able to find the questions that are easy for you and identify the questions that are more difficult. Do easy questions first. You will later struggle with difficult questions that require a lot of thinking. Always do the easiest questions first!</p> <p><strong>3. DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING REMAINING.</strong> Follow the above recommendation and do not forget the questions that are difficult to complete as discarded! After you have completed the easy questions, you must go back to the questions that are difficult for you and puzzle over them. DO NOT LOOK AT THE OPTIONS, THINK FOR YOURSELF. After reading the question, do not rush to look at the options. Assuming that the options are not given, try to answer the question independently, relying on your own opinion. Once you find the answer, you can look at the options! Even if the exact answer you are thinking of is not among the options, there may be an answer that is closest to it. Using this method, you will be able to quickly find the correct answer.</p> <p><strong>5. DELETE OBVIOUSLY WRONG ANSWERS.</strong> Only one of the answers given in the options is correct. Delete the wrong answers from the rest of the test and ignore them altogether. Crossing out answers that are obviously wrong before finding the right answer will help you focus. Remove redundant answers, and only the correct answer will be visible to you.</p> <p><strong>6. BE CAREFUL WHEN CHOOSING ABSOLUTE ANSWERS.</strong> Absolute answers can include options such as "None of the above," "All of the above," or "All of the answers are correct." These types of answers are almost always incorrect, and unless you are absolutely sure that at least two of the above answers are correct, do not mark them as correct!</p> <p><strong>7. SWIM ACROSS THE STREAM.</strong> Notice the word or phrase before the _________ space where you need to put the answer. Which answer from the answer options seems correct to you? If the word or phrase before the blank space and the word in the answer option you choose are proportional, and seem to be correct in terms of meaning, then there is a high probability that this is the correct option of the test.</p> <p><img src="https://telegra.ph/file/12a07d9af5a679d12c88c.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>8. ALWAYS CHOOSE ANSWER B OR C AT RISK.</strong> Test makers often place the correct answer in the middle of the options. Therefore, wrong answers are often given in option A, which is the first answer, or option D, which is the last answer. If you don't know the exact answer to a question, always use B or C as your guess.</p> <p>The above is just a suggestion for solving multiple-choice tests. In fact, more reading, learning and research are required of you to complete the test completely correctly. Because the work of a well-trained and educated person cannot be canceled even with any number of difficult tests. Read and you will surely do the tests correctly! Just trust your knowledge! I believe in you. You can do it! — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/imtiyozi-bor-abituriyentlarning-javobi-mandatdan-oldin-chiqqan" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>How do you feel about this news?
