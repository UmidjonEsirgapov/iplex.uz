Can I believe what they say? <p>Currently, some individuals and legal entities providing consulting services are campaigning among our youth to submit documents for admission to foreign higher education organizations.</p> <p><strong>In order for the diploma of a foreign higher education organization offered to you to be recognized in Uzbekistan, pay attention to the following:</strong></p> <p>First of all, it is necessary to check whether it has a document (license) allowing to operate as a higher education institution.</p> <p>The next most important requirement is related to the recognition of the document issued by the educational institution, that is, the diploma in the territory of the country where it is located. To do this, check whether the higher education institution and its educational programs have been accredited by the competent authorities.</p> <p>In addition, the applicant should find out whether the chosen higher education institution's teaching format and educational programs comply with the legislation of Uzbekistan.
