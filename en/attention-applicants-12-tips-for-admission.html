                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>It will greatly help you master the subjects.</strong><br/><strong>Studies show that a certain break should be taken between lessons and revision.</strong><br/><strong>However, during exam preparation, smartphones can become the biggest distraction.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Exams There are techniques that are essential during preparation, which can significantly improve memory, focus and even mood.</p> <p>The BBC has drawn on the opinions of neuroscientists, psychologists, nutritionists and teachers and students to compile a list of tips that can help applicants succeed.</p> <ol> <li><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Breakfast and brain food</strong><img alt="" src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/1/1100__-v3hAd21UlGZhs_xUZ1UYF43sNbpMUsu.jpg"/></li> </ol> <p>Energy is required for the proper functioning of the body. And the brain's ability to concentrate depends on a steady source of energy in the form of glucose.</p> <p>Studies show that students who skip breakfast are better able to focus and remember information during exams. whole grain bread or low-sugar muesli.</p> <p>Also, breakfast should include some protein: a small amount of milk, yogurt or eggs.</p> <p>These products have been proven to have a positive effect on brain function: eggs, fish, whole grains, dark green vegetables such as cabbage, spinach and broccoli, tomatoes and avocados.</p> <p>Contain antioxidants and Drinks containing anthocyanins can boost memory and mood for a short time. These substances are also found in blueberries, strawberries, walnuts, olives, pumpkin seeds and dark chocolate.</p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">2. Start everything early</strong></p> <p><img alt="" src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/1/1100__ic_41X0s1EPduXxFopLGFbK_8N_q-To6.jpg"/></p> <p>Try to start preparing several months before the exams, not just before the exam. Then your self-confidence will increase.</p> <p>Prepare lessons early in the morning. At this time, the brain is sufficiently rested. Do not leave most of the lessons until the afternoon.</p> <p>The best thing is to make a schedule of lessons for yourself, try to start and finish studying at the same time every day. This will greatly help you master the subjects.</p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">3. Determine exactly what to focus on</strong></p> <p>What type of exam are you preparing for? Written, oral or in the form of a test?</p> <p>Each type of exam requires different preparation methods.</p> <p>It is not necessary to carefully study all subjects for a written-creative exam. It is enough to study the subject in the center of the exam in depth.</p> <p>For a multiple-choice test, again, a serious understanding of the curriculum is necessary.</p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">4. Make a plan</strong></p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong"><img alt="" src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/1/1100__AQ6n5k2D5_lTeAsY-prXRs38TeAsB4uJ.jpg"/></strong></p> <p>For most students, sticking to a plan can be difficult, but it can save a lot of time. </p> <p>If you make a plan, after one lesson you won't waste a minute trying to decide which one to start.</p> <p>However, the plan should be clear and thorough. Include not only which subjects to study in order, but also topics and notes.</p> <p>And don't forget to take breaks, play sports, and socialize with people.</p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">5. Break is your best helper</strong></p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong"><img alt="" src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/1/1100___aH-oFiNgmA9tH_7jwBAhcdtnM3qOKvu.jpg"/></strong></p> <p>Make sure there is a break between classes. It is more effective to study science for 1 hour for 10 days than to study for 10 hours in one day.</p> <p>There is a saying that repetition is the mother of knowledge. But don't try to repeat the lesson learned right away. Research shows that a certain amount of time should be taken between studying and reviewing.</p> <p>The time allows for the learning to be remembered to a certain extent, and during the repetition after the break, the information is better embedded in the brain.</p> <p>This method is recognized as "one of the most reliable in the history of memory research".</p> <p>But relying on only one method to pass the exam </p> <p>Writing down important information, conducting group question-and-answer sessions, and recording and replaying these conversations can also dramatically increase retention.</p> <p>Also, don't spend too much time and effort on popular, but research-proven, ineffective methods of repetition and memorization.</p> <p>For example, highlighting sentences in a book with colored markers has little to no effect. proven.</p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">6. Constantly test yourself</strong></p> <p>According to the world's leading psychologists and neurobiologists, "self-examination" can be one of the most effective ways to absorb information.</p> <p>Questioning yourself about what you have learned will help you understand the topic more deeply and clearly.</p> <p>Test yourself several times on practice tests before the exam. and try to identify your weak points.</p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">7. Become a teacher</strong></p> <p>So, you have studied the topic, repeated based on the above methods and tested yourself. So, what should be done now?</p> <p>Of course, try to teach others what you have learned.</p> <p>Memory and memorization will increase dramatically. The reason is that in order for you to explain the topic to others, you must first of all master it yourself.</p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">8. Hide the phone</strong></p> <p>There is no point in arguing that smartphones are the closest assistants in the modern world.</p> <p>However, smartphones can become the biggest distraction during exam preparation.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with becoming a "slave" to social networks and messengers under the influence of "Fear of missing out" (Fear of missing out effect). no.</p> <p>So, before starting preparations, hide the phone somewhere until the exam.</p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">9. Less music, more silence</strong></p> <p>Some people like to prepare with music or headphones. However, this can hinder the assimilation of information in the brain.</p> <p>Try to ensure that there is silence around during the lesson.</p> <p>10. Fresh air and exercise</p> <p>Preparation without rest is fruitless work. Resting the brain, taking a walk in the fresh air and exercising the body are the guarantee of a high result.</p> <p>Body and mind are inextricably linked. Exercise improves blood circulation and provides more oxygen to the brain. After all, a clear mind is necessary for the exam.</p> <p>Walking in the heart of nature calms a person down and increases self-confidence.</p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">11. Get enough sleep</strong></p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong"><img alt="" src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/1/1100__TTBYOCWkjC_iuRg9D3g5HmQze1BER7Ko.jpg"/></strong></p> <p>It is necessary for you to sleep well the day before the exam.</p> <p>During the preparation period, it is possible try to go to bed earlier. Then, you will be able to sleep well and get up early, and you will have time to do the planned work for the whole day. Believe me, you will hardly achieve any results with such determination.</p> <p>Sometimes it may not be possible to stop the lesson from midnight to midnight. However, try to spend the night sleeping as much as possible.</p> <p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">12. Be calm and positive. Follow the above tips and be successful.</strong></p> <p>No matter how strong the competition is when you get into school, it should not be a reason for you to get discouraged.</p> <p>At least now you know how to work on yourself effectively.</p> <p>The main thing is to try to keep calm and high spirits. Otherwise, it won't help you study for hours.</p> <p>And finally, one of the last and important tips: don't forget to reward yourself after the exam. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/b1-darajadagi-sertifikat-abituriyentlarga-qanday-imkoniyatlar-beradi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: prepared based on the information of the oliygoh.uz site..
