                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>It was also free.</strong><br/><strong>— How do Uzbek students live and study in the USA?</strong><br/><strong>Some universities say: "no, students live in our dorms, not outside the university."</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>Top of the world Javahir Ganiboyev from Namangan is among the Uzbek students who are studying in the universities. Now he is studying at the University of Florida. In his interview, he talked about how to prepare for admission to a foreign university, the process of collecting documents, and how to create conditions for foreign students in the United States.</h4> <p class="iframe-wrapper">Video Player<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KFBgN2KCE-U?controls=1&amp;rel=0&amp;disablekb=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;html5=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;autopl ay=0&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;playsinline=1&amp;start=0&amp;fs=1&amp;nocookie=false&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fkun.uz&amp;widgetid=1"></iframe></p> <p>At the age of 17, Jawahir scored high scores in IELs and SAT exams, managed to enter a total of 50 universities in the USA, Europe and Switzerland and won a $3 million grant. At the moment, he is studying at the University of South Florida in the field of "Computer Science" in the 1st stage. Jawahir says that he has set himself the goal of working as a programmer in giant IT companies: Google or Meta. From October to February of my 11th grade, I applied to 70 American and European universities and was accepted to 50. In social networks, they wrote that there are 40, but it is not so. I won a total of 3 million dollars in grants, including universities that gave full grants. Among them, I chose the University of South Florida. This university is developing very fast. When I applied, it was ranked 300th, and now it is in the top 100.</p> <p>This university offered me a grant of 24,000 dollars. I chose this university despite the fact that it was the least among the grants I received. Because this university ranks high in the field of IT. A grant of 6,000 dollars per year is allocated, which is not a large amount. In addition, I applied to other grants of our university. Our engineering department also has "external scholarships", so they give more grants, and now I have submitted my documents for them.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/XLn_xmEh5OPQ8lI_RVILGN0ogmi640RJ.jpg"/>Javahir Ganiboyev</p> <p>My highest grant was from Ithaca College in New York. This university provided a "full tuition" grant. American universities have 2 different types of grants. These are: "full tuition" and "Fulbright scholarship". "Full tuition" is only for the contract amount. This "full tuition" grant was provided by Ithaca College, it was 45 thousand dollars a year. The reason I didn't choose is because in the US, college and university are in the same position, the university is bigger and the colleges are smaller. The university where I am currently studying has 200 departments and has an area of ​​6,400 square meters. Occupies a very large area. And Ithaca college is smaller, and it doesn't have a high ranking in my field. That is, with this, you will find out how many fields are taught in it and how many conditions are created for students".</p> <p><strong>- What should young people who want to apply to universities in the USA start with?</strong></p> <p>- The first thing to do is get an IELs or Duolingo certificate. A score of 6.5 on IELs and 120 on Duolingo is required. What's next after that? If you are late for the SAT, you can still apply. But this does not give the opportunity to apply to TOP universities.</p> <p>Then what is needed is school grades. You translate the document with grades into English and take it to the school principal. The director will have to send this paper to the desired address.</p> <p>After that, a "personal statement" is written. "Personal statement" is an essay about yourself, in which the candidate must advertise himself in 650 words. How to write depends on the person. In addition, in the process, information is also provided about what activities are engaged in at school. That is, the applicant must not be limited to school for years. Outside of school, has he helped or taught anyone, started clubs? These things are also very important. Because you must be busy with something. This is done, when the profile is ready, it can be sent to the university.</p> <p>Then "recommendation letters" are requested. Letters of recommendation are written by the school principal and teachers. Since most of our teachers do not speak English well, they write the letter of recommendation in Uzbek. The applicant will have to translate it himself. I also translated it myself.</p> <p>For the bachelor course, it is submitted through the Common app application. Enter the necessary information there. Common app is one of the most popular apps. Only up to 20 universities can be applied through this platform. Once you've filled out your profile and uploaded your documents, they'll all be sent to 20 universities in one go.</p> <p>So what if you want to apply to more than that? There is another application for this - Coalition app. Many young Uzbeks do not know this. In this application, the information is filled in the same way as mentioned above. The superior side of these two apps is that one is free. Typically, US universities pay between $50 and $200. These apps will save you at least $1,000.</p> <p>Also, universities have their own websites. You can also submit a document through them. I also submitted it in this way. It was also free. Because the director of the school received letters from the universities, that is, if the financial situation of the candidate was reported, the opportunity to apply for free was created.</p> <p><strong>- How do Uzbek students live and study in the USA? Does OTM create any conditions for this? If you tell me about these things too.</strong></p> <p>- After correcting the documents and getting the visas, you will have the opportunity to come one month earlier. Studies here start in August. I also came a month ago and lived in Chicago, not Florida. Because our brothers from Uchkurgan were there.</p> <p>There are various organizations here that help students to have a good life in America and study well at the university. For example, "International student service" asks how you are doing. In addition, they ask, "Are there any difficulties in classes, which subjects do you have difficulty with?". Separate frames are allocated for this process. That is, in addition to studying the subject in which the student is struggling, he is also invited to a free club. This is one of the biggest advantages. If a student tries, he will never fall behind.</p> <p>For example, I want to become a programmer. I will have to study mathematics and physics perfectly. In addition to the physics lesson, physics laboratory lessons are also given. That is, all necessary subjects are taught perfectly. One of the best parts is that you can choose everything from which building to which professor will teach and when. I was given this opportunity from my freshman year, but it made me feel uncomfortable because I didn't know anything about the university. They directed special personnel and consultants to this and explained everything to us. Even if the work and studies of the students have increased and they are under stress, psychologists are attached to them and they work with them individually. This will help the student a lot.</p> <p>Besides, medicine is very developed in our university. There is a hospital treating cancer patients in this place. Students can go out and easily learn practical aspects. In general, the university has all the opportunities, even if it is a small town.</p> <p><strong>- Where do you live now?</strong></p> <p>- When international students come to every university, they need a place to live and food to eat. American universities have their own policies and requirements. Some universities say: "No, students live in our dormitories, not outside the university." Some of them say: "If he wants, he can live in the dormitory, if he wants, he can live outside." Our university gave us freedom to live and do what we do. You can stay outside or inside the university as you wish. We chose Florida because it's relatively cheap to live off-campus. We go home by bike from the university, we stay 5 minutes away. Everything you need is near us. There are also shops around our place of residence. It's a very comfortable area.</p> <p>Also, another great thing about America is that no one cares how you study, whether you do classes or not. If you don't study well, you will burn your money, so everyone tries to study well. That is, if you don't go to class once, if you don't do homework, no one will ask. These things only work to the detriment of the student. Professors don't say anything, "Why didn't you come?" he doesn't even ask. If you fail the exam at the end, you will have to retake it. One lesson here costs about 2 thousand dollars. The most important thing is time, you can lose time in this process.</p> <p><strong>Dilshoda Shomirzayeva spoke.
