                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The atmosphere in our educational center does not leave students interested in studying and learning. they did.</strong><br/><strong>- says Ikhtiyor Tursunov, the founder of the Fergana branch.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>The "Registon" educational project was built on the basis of the single highest mission: to bring the education of Uzbekistan to the first place in the world! Our creative team visited the branches of our educational center in the valley, where they learned what the "Registon" family is doing, what innovations they have prepared for the development of the education system in our country and the achievement of our goals, and how satisfied the local population is with our activities. It will be discussed below.</p> <p><strong>We chose "Registon"! Because...</strong></p> <p>During our visit to the Andijan branch, we were accompanied by the head of the branch Jasurbek Yusupov. This branch is located opposite the train station in Andijan city, near the Babur statue in the area called "Yangibozor" in the local language.</p> <p><img class="wp-image-22259 aligncenter" src="https://rgn.uz/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Andijon-filiali-21.06.23-06-300x200.jpg"/></p> <p>Our Andijon branch is established in a brick building that will make everyone jealous. Just like prestigious universities abroad and our own Westminster! It is convenient in every way, next to the train station, near the market, the bus station...</p> <p>The first floor consists of a reception hall. There are 20 rooms on the second floor, 17 of which are study rooms, and the other three are the director's room, kitchen and library. Today, more than 25 professional teachers work in our educational center. 17 of them are English language teachers, and the rest are teachers who prepare applicants. Such a small team has been teaching about 500 students!</p> <p>Like other branches, the Andijan branch mainly specializes in the English language, that is, English is taught in an in-depth manner compared to other subjects. Our English language teachers and other teachers who prepare applicants are real owners and experts in their field. They are considered to be professional teachers who graduated from Turkish high schools, studied in foreign countries, or at least gained their qualifications abroad. You will also immerse yourself in the debates and learning processes here! The atmosphere in our educational center does not leave students interested in studying and learning. We were especially interested in the unique design of the rooms and the fact that they were named after famous cities. When you enter the teacher's class and get their opinion, the students say that they receive quality education here, the results are positive and they can see their future with "Registan LC". that they will receive a bonus in addition to their monthly salary for the tests they have prepared for the tests, as well as for their additional lessons;</p> <p>- that additional bonuses will be assigned to their students if they show good results in the IELTS;</p> <p>- They emphasized that the lessons will be taught from special books and not from the curriculum or work plans. It was evident from their faces that they like the environment in the Andijan branch of our educational center, the conditions created here, the satisfaction of the teachers, the top manager and our students. A teacher who wants to start a new job first talks with the HR manager and then with the supervisor. In the second stage, all teachers teach children in front of them and demonstrate their method and pedagogical skills. After learning the books, skills, and experience of other teachers during the one-week trial period, they will be taught and accepted into our team. Only the strongest and most dedicated professionals can join us!</p> <p>Students take the exam 4-5 times until they finish one book. Exams are divided into internal and external exams. In addition, monthly mock tests are also organized regularly. Exams are designed to be as similar as possible to DTM practice tests. The purpose of this is to prepare students mentally and psychologically.</p> <p>When we entered the room called "California", sister Shahistakhan Hamrokulova, whose result was 8.0, was teaching. This person works as an IELTS instructor at the Andijan branch of "Registon", and at the same time, he is also the leader of the IELTS teachers in the branch. We were very happy with our team to hear the broad worldview and clear thoughts of the students who have common goals, big plans, bright eyes, who are studying with enthusiasm and enthusiasm. Preparatory courses for presidential schools, Russian language and English language courses are crowded with children here. As a proof of our opinion, you can witness the children speaking English fluently during the video. Parents trust and see their child's future with "Registan LC", and our teachers never stop trying to achieve good results and brighten their faces!</p> <p>- I teach CEFR at the Andijan branch of "Registan LC". With my current knowledge and degree, I can easily work in other educational centers, private schools, private universities or state HEIs. But I chose "Registon". Because here the teacher is not treated as a secondary person, from the managers to our superiors, they show special respect to the teachers. Compared to other educational centers, students are eager for knowledge, hardworking, friendly and kind. Working and teaching at Registon is easy and fun! That's why I'm here! - says Dilnoza Asadullayeva, an English language teacher, CEFR instructor, whose hundreds of students have shown results. During the video, you can distinguish and understand the difference between CEFR and IELTS by listening to our teacher's valuable thoughts!</p> <p>In addition, if you want to know about the unusual aspect of the Andijan branch that is 100% different from other branches, click on the link and watch the video now!</p> <p class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CQJeFiULKGI?start=126&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><strong> </strong> they did. The Fergana branch is located on "Yuksalish" street in Kuvasoy, "Ekstrenniy kocha" in the local language, between "Sultan Ahmed" restaurant and "Istiqlol grand" cakes.</p> <p><img class="size-medium wp-image-22260 aligncenter" src="https://rgn.uz/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Fargona-filiali-20.06.23-03-300x200.jpg"/></p> <p>Our attention was drawn to the fact that a coworking zone and classrooms have been organized in the basement of the building in our Fergona branch, and even one square meter of land has been used effectively. On the second floor there are classrooms for English language and training of applicants, on the third floor there are summer school, i.e. courses for young children and IELTS preparation classrooms, meeting hall. </p> <p>Fergana branch of "Registon" today has about 100 employees and more than 2200 students. These numbers continue to grow. Despite the fact that this branch has been opened for 1 year, about 80 IELTS results have been issued. The highest score was 7.5. Our teachers intend to record more than 200 results by the end of the year. In addition, more than 400 students will be trained in applicant subjects, and more than 100 of them will pass this year.</p> <p>The good thing is that "Registon" educational center has cooperation with "IDP IELTS". The IELTS Mock zone on the third floor was organized in cooperation with "IDP IELTS". This makes it much easier for residents of Fergana to pass IELTS exams. Fergana residents don't need to go to Tashkent to take IELTS, they can easily take the exam at the "Registan LC" branch in Fergana!</p> <p>The capacity of the Fergana branch is designed for 3,500 people! Support zones can accommodate 100 people on average. Support teachers work with students in 2 shifts, from morning to evening. The main goal is to strengthen knowledge, to master the subjects perfectly, to analyze with support what they did not understand in the lessons, and to record good results.</p> <p>Our Fergana branch has a number of requirements for hiring support teachers and main teachers. Here, assistant teachers are divided into two: assistant teachers working in the coworking zone on the lower floor with Beginner, Elementary, Pre-intermediate levels and assistant teachers working in the upper coworking zone with Intermediate, IELTS levels. We attach them to the lead mentor before hiring them. We have leading teachers from all disciplines, first they try and recommend to us, then we conduct an interview with that person. In the end, they give us a lesson, and then we train them based on our special programs. We observe, if there is a staff who really has pedagogic skills, who knows his field perfectly and corresponds to our values, we will certainly accept them into our team!</p> <p>- I am a history teacher. The "Registon" educational center fully corresponded to my values. That is, I had the intention to develop the education system and, if necessary, to reform it, drawing conclusions from the mistakes we made yesterday. Then I started working here, and today, together with my students and the "Registan LC" family, we are walking boldly, our plans and goals are very big! - says Avazbek Ortiqaliyev, a teacher of history and legal sciences.</p> <p>Head of the branch Ikhtiyor Tursunov said that summer is considered a vacation month for many, but this season is one of the most productive and blessed seasons for students who are hungry for knowledge. That's why today 30-35 parents visit our branch and talk with our managers. Happily, 90-95% of them like the environment and conditions in our educational center and entrust their children to our teachers.</p> <p>Also, there are some lazy students, their motivation "dies" in the summer and they drop out with various excuses. We launched the "Exam King" project in order to keep them interested in studying. That is, the exam is taken every month and the students with the highest and lowest scores are announced. We will reward those who have good results, they will become "Exam king", and we will give time to those who have shown negative results, if there is no change in them in 2-3 months, we will cancel the contract and say goodbye to them...</p> <p>- We did not search, find and collect this team. God gave us this team, they found us with their feet. We got together and the team turned out to be better than we wanted and our students expected. The focus of the team members was focused on one place, all the forces and opportunities were directed towards one goal, the fist hit in one place, you see, "Registan LC" Fergana branch was left in the rain of students' flow and results...</p> <p>If we talk a lot, if you write, it will become the sixth epic of "Khamsa"! Better yet, come and see for yourself. Thank you very much, we are moving towards great goals in the big educational project, if we are lucky, we will achieve our dreams together in the future, we will bring the educational system of Uzbekistan to the first place in the world! - says Ikhtiyor Tursunov, the founder of the Fergana branch.</p> <p>When we went up to the third floor of our educational center, we saw that the place was divided into two. Half of them are English language classes for children, and the other half are English language rooms and an auditorium for large gatherings. All the English language teachers of our educational center gathered in the auditorium and exchanged ideas within the framework of the "Teaching Bootcamp" project.
