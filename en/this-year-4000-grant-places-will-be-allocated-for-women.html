One of the most important news is the allocation of 4,000 special state grants for women. 4,000 special grants for women are planned to be allocated in cooperation with the Family and Women's Committee. These grants are aimed at expanding the opportunities of women in higher education, encouraging them and ensuring social equality. Through this, women from disadvantaged or remote areas will have the opportunity to get higher education.</p> <h3>1320 grants to non-state and foreign HEIs</h3> <p>According to the order, a total of 1320 state grants will be allocated to <strong>foreign higher education institutions and their branches</strong>, as well as to <strong>non-state HEIs</strong> provided. These grants serve to support the non-state sector and create a competitive environment in education.</p> <h3>30 grants for young citizens abroad</h3> <p>Another noteworthy aspect is the allocation of 30 separate grants for <strong>young citizens living abroad</strong>. This initiative gives young people living far away from their homeland the opportunity to get an education in their own country.</p> <h3>List of HEIs participating in the distribution of state orders</h3> <p>In the order, it is determined to form a list of <strong>non-state HEIs</strong> that expressed their desire to participate in the distribution of state orders. This opens the way for the private sector to take an active part in the state grant system.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Special grants allocated for women, foreign nationals and non-state higher education institutions for the 2025/2026 academic year, based on the presidential decree, serve to make higher education inclusive and fair. In particular, grants for 4,000 women are an important step towards social equality.
