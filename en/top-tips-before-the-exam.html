It is natural to be stressed at such a time. But it is possible and necessary to overcome stress. The following tips are useful for applicants who feel under pressure before the exam.</p> <h3>🕒 1. Complete the preparation 17-18 hours before the exam</h3> <p>In the last hours, it is recommended to consolidate existing knowledge, not to acquire knowledge. A lot of recent reading reduces the ability to remember, which increases stress during the exam.</p> <h3>🚫 2. Don't allow yourself to study indiscriminately</h3> <p>Looking through books with the thought of "reading something" on the eve of the exam will only increase your confusion. In this case, your brain remembers only a small part.</p> <h3>😌 3. Don't forget to rest - let the brain "reload"</h3> <p>Walking, showering, watching comedy shows is the best rest for the brain. Laughter is a natural remedy for stress.</p> <h3>💤 4. Quality sleep is the key to success</h3> <p>You should sleep well before the exam. For this reason, it is recommended not to consume caffeinated drinks (tea, coffee, cola, chocolate) in the afternoon.</p> <h3>🎬 5. Try the visualization technique</h3> <p>Imagine the exam process in front of your eyes - you will enter the auditorium, choose a ticket, confidently say the answers... this will increase mental preparation and reduce stress.</p> <h3>🍽 6. Pay attention to dinner</h3> <p>To improve the quality of sleep, avoid protein-rich foods, choose light carbohydrates. Drinking hot water with honey calms the nervous system.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Stress before an exam is a natural state. But the right approach, healthy sleep, strong mental preparation and relaxation methods will help to overcome this condition. Exam is just a stage in life. The most important thing to pass it is trust and calmness. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/mandatga-2-kun-qoldi-abituriyentlar-uchun-eng-muhim-maslahatlar-va-imkoniyatlar" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
