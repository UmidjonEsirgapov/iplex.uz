                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Is higher education in Germany absolutely free?</strong><br/><strong>However, students are required to pay a semester fee.</strong><br/><strong>Offered course: Bachelor of Science: International Business Studies (more) Curriculum language: English Duration: 6 semesters Curriculum fee: Studying in this course is free Dates for submitting documents: At the moment, the application period for the winter semester of the university has not yet opened. Let's take a look at one of the <strong>bachelor</strong> courses and the application process. <p><strong>Is higher education in Germany </strong><strong>absolutely</strong><strong> free?</strong></p> <p>As we all know, Germany is one of the few countries where higher education is free for national and international students. In addition, it is considered one of the most developed countries in the world. It is natural for any person to have the desire to study in Germany at least once. Now the question arises, "Is education in Germany really completely free?" <u><strong>The answer is "Yes and No".</strong></u> I will try to give a full explanation below for the answer.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong></p> <p>Most universities in Germany (national and government funded) do not charge students a tuition fee. But students are required to pay the semester fee. The cost of the semester fee may vary from one university to another, but in most universities the amount of this fee does not exceed 250 euros per semester. We can say that education in Germany is free because it is not a big amount and this fee is charged for administrative work done by the university for the student. But not all universities in Germany are absolutely free. As an example, we can take universities in cities that are part of the German <strong>Baden-Wurttemberg</strong> region. These universities have started demanding tuition fees from international students for some courses from the 2017/18 academic year. That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany. But education in most universities is free, as we said above.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Education in Germany through English:</strong></p> <p>As in many developed countries, German universities offer courses taught in English. But the number of such courses for a bachelor's degree is significantly less than for a master's degree. But this does not mean that it does not exist at all. Today we will talk about FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg, which offers such a bachelor's course, and the procedure for sending documents for the bachelor's course it offers. Briefly about FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg: Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg) is the third largest university in the Bavarian region of Germany. <strong>#198 in the ranking of world universities presented by <strong>THE</strong> (Times Higher Education).</strong></p> <p><strong><img alt="See the source image" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R9aea0527f043bdd0babd91fedbee859e?rik=BQaxUa9Tp0ib8Q&amp;riu=http%3a%2f%2fupload.wikimedia.org%2fwikipedia%2fc ommons%2f2%2f2b%2fSchloss-Erlangen02.JPG&amp;ehk=jyN9YJN8xXIzfdAHr%2ffrMjvduASHYTSWcaba1N0I7%2fQ%3d&amp;risl=1&amp;pid=ImgRaw"/></strong></p> <p><strong>Course offered:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Bachelor of Science: International Business Studies (<strong>details</strong>)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Curriculum language:</strong></p> <ul> <li>English</li> </ul> <p><strong>Duration:</strong></p> <ul> <li>6 semesters</li> </ul> <p><strong>Curriculum fee:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Studying in this course is free</li> </ul> <p><strong>Dates for sending documents:</strong></p> <p>Currently, the period for accepting documents for the winter semester of the university has not yet opened. Admission for international students <strong>will continue until July 15 for the winter semester 2021.</strong></p> <p><strong>Requirements for candidates:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Applicants for bachelor courses at almost all German universities are required to have completed a bachelor's degree or the first stage of a bachelor's degree <u>(if the candidate completed an academic lyceum before entering the university)</u>, as well as requires transcripts of the second stage of the bachelor's degree <u>(if the candidate graduated from college before entering the university)</u>. <strong>The same is required for this course;</strong></li> </ol> <p><strong>Required documents:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Extract of diploma or first/second year ranking grades (in the case of translation);</li> <li>Completed university application form;</li> <li>Copy of passport;</li> <li>Motivational letter (some courses may not ask);</li> <li>Recommendation (some departments may not ask for it).</li> </ol> <p>You can check other additional documents <strong>here</strong> after the admission for the course has started.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>More here</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/imtihon-vaqtlari-kechiktirilishi-mumkin" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education..</strong>
