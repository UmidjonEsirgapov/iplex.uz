                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>That is, employees studying in higher and secondary special, vocational educational institutions without separation from production, one day a week to complete a diploma project (work) or prepare for training during the ten academic months before passing graduation exams. they will be released from work while maintaining the average salary.</strong><br/><strong>Those reading this article may have another question, namely, are the benefits only for students?</strong><br/><strong>So, according to Article 85 of the Labor Code, the initial trial period should not be more than three months. can they work?</strong> Of course they can. According to the labor legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan, there are no restrictions on this. We justify our opinion as follows. According to Article 77 of the Labor Code (hereinafter referred to as the Labor Code), every person who has reached the age of sixteen (16) has the right to work. <p>In order to prepare young people for work, students of general education schools, secondary specialized and vocational schools are assigned light work that does not harm their health and spiritual and moral development, and does not disrupt the educational process. in order to complete their studies in their spare time - after they reach the age of fifteen, it is allowed to get a job with the written consent of one of their parents or one of their substitutes. No. 1222, 22.02.2003) in accordance with paragraph 50, it is established that students studying in the form of full-time education can work in higher educational institutions and other organizations with an employment contract during their free time. It follows that students can work freely. But according to the labor law, a student has the right to work only during his spare time. It should not be forgotten that the main activity of a student is to acquire knowledge. That is, education should be a priority.</p> <p><strong>Here another question arises. That is, if a student can work, can they work the full 1 rate or only 0.5 rate? </strong>As we said above, a student can only <strong>work during free time </strong>from studying. According to Article 115 of the Civil Code, the working time of an employee should not exceed 40 hours per week. To be more precise, in enterprises, institutions and organizations where a 6-day working week is introduced, the working time must not exceed 7 hours a day, and in those where a 5-day working week is introduced, the working time must not exceed 8 hours a day. Also, the daily rest period between the end of work and the start of work on the next day (shift) cannot be less than twelve hours (Article 128 of the Criminal Code). If a student has enough free time, there is no obstacle for him to work full-time.</p> <p>In addition, the employer must provide a number of benefits for employees who combine work with education. In particular, in accordance with Article 249 of the Civil Code, employees who are studying in educational institutions without separating from production and completing the curriculum in accordance with the procedure established by labor laws and other regulatory documents:</p> <p>• take additional paid leave from the workplace;</p> <p>• have the right to work in the conditions of a shortened work week and receive other benefits.</p> <p>Another important privilege is the annual vacation of students. taking into account that the employer should adjust the time of exams and sessions to employees of this category according to their wishes (Article 253 of the Civil Code). That's why the law has given another privilege for student-employees. That is, employees who are studying in higher and secondary special, vocational educational institutions without separation from production are released from work with one day of average salary per week during the six-day working week in order to complete the diploma project (work) or prepare for training during the ten academic months before passing graduation exams. If the working week is five days, the number of days exempted from work changes depending on the duration of the work shift, while the number of hours exempted from work remains the same (Article 255 of the Labor Code). According to Article 256 of the Civil Code, at least thirty calendar days per year for those studying by correspondence in higher and secondary special educational institutions; at least thirty calendar days per year for those studying in the evening form of education in higher educational institutions in the third and subsequent years, at least twenty calendar days per year for those studying in secondary special educational institutions, and at least forty calendar days per year for those studying part-time in higher and secondary special educational institutions; at least thirty calendar days in the period of graduation exams in higher and secondary special educational institutions; during the period of preparation and approval of the diploma project (work), the students of the higher educational institution are given additional vacations for a period of four months, and for the students of the secondary special educational institution, two months, with the average monthly salary preserved. is given. During this vacation period, students and pupils will be awarded scholarships on general basis. The above norms are also applied to those studying by correspondence in the neighboring republics.</p> <p>Readers of this article may have another question, namely, are the benefits only for students? What about high school students? There are many applicants who are engaged in work, are there any benefits for them? Yes, of course there is. According to Article 254 of the Civil Code, employees who are allowed to take entrance exams are given at least fifteen calendar days of unpaid leave to enter higher educational institutions. Therefore, the employer is obliged to create conditions for the employee to submit an application to the OTM and pass the exam.</p> <p>Nowadays, the phrase that is repeated a lot by employers is "I will hire you with a trial period of three or four months. If you pass the test, you can continue to work." So, what are the provisions of the current labor legislation regarding the probationary period? So, in accordance with Article 85 of the Labor Code, the initial trial period should not exceed three months.</p> <p>Another important aspect is that during the trial period, the labor laws and the working conditions established in the enterprise are fully applied to the employees. The initial trial period is included in the length of service. That is, the employees working during the probationary period will receive full wages, bonuses and other additional payments.</p> <p>Also, graduates of secondary special, vocational educational institutions and higher educational institutions, who enter the job for the first time within three years from the date of graduation from the relevant educational institution, will not be assigned a preliminary test. Therefore, if the employer tells you about the trial period, do not forget to remind him of your rights!</p> <p>Based on the above comments, students of higher educational institutions can work under a legal employment contract. It is natural for students who read this article to have questions. That is, if a student asks for a job and the employer refuses to hire him, what should the student do? According to Article 78 of the Criminal Code, illegal refusal of employment is not allowed. According to Article 49 of the Code of Administrative Responsibility of the Republic of Uzbekistan, violation of labor and labor protection laws by an official will result in a fine of five to 10 times the base calculation amount (the base calculation amount is 223 thousand soums). In addition, in case of refusal of employment according to Article 78 of the Labor Code, upon the request of the applicant, the employer must give a written answer within three days, justifying the reason for the refusal of employment. This answer must be signed by an official who has the right to employ. We know that employers prefer men to women. The reason for this is that female employees take leave for pregnancy and childbirth, as well as taking care of their children under the age of three. Therefore, the employer does not want to hire women. Taking these reasons into account, the legislator strengthened the protection of women's rights by law. We justify our opinion as follows. According to the second part of Article 148 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan, unlawfully refusing to hire or dismissing a woman, knowing that she is pregnant or caring for a young child, is punishable by a fine of up to twenty-five times the amount of the basic calculation, or deprivation of certain rights for up to three years, or correctional labor for up to three years. Most of the girls get married during their student years, and as a result, they face many obstacles in getting a job. Therefore, it would be beneficial if our female students were aware of this norm.</p> <p>Therefore, if the employer refuses to hire you instead of an available job, ask him to give a written answer on the basis of his refusal, and if the employer refuses to hire you illegally, contact the local labor inspector or the prosecutor's office!</p> <p><strong>Muhammadamina Karimjonov,</strong></p> <p><strong>Teacher of the Labor Law Department of Tashkent State Law University,</strong></p> <p><strong>Daniyor Imomniyozov, 4th year student</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/talabalar-haftaligi-doirasida-men-talabaman-videoroliklar-tanlovi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
