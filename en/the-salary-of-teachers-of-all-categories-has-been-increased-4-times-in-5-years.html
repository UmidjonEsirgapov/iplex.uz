                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>if he works, his monthly salary will definitely exceed a thousand dollars. percent of places are allocated.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>The salaries of all categories of teachers in Uzbekistan have been increased four times since 2017. Komiljon Karimov, the first deputy minister of higher education, science and innovation, said this in an interview with "Daryo".</p> <p class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zh11GrJlA4s"></iframe></p> <p>The official of the Ministry said that the teachers working in higher education institutions receive an average monthly salary of around 10 million soums. If we compare with 2017, in the past five years, the salaries of our teachers of all categories have increased four times. Today, the average salary of teachers in higher education institutions exceeds 10 million soums. If we talk about professors and teachers, their salaries are more than a thousand dollars. This is definitely a positive thing. Because this will create an opportunity to retain and attract highly qualified personnel in the system. if he tries, his salary will definitely exceed a thousand dollars. Today, the number of professors and teachers with academic degrees in state HEIs is more than 37 percent of the total number of teachers," he said.</p> <p><strong>Earlier, Komiljon Karimov said that attention has been paid to supporting students in need of social protection.</strong></p> <p>"First of all, opportunities are being created for students with disabilities, orphans, and children from low-income families to receive higher education. For example, two percent seats from the general quota are being reserved for students with disabilities. A special selection is being made for them when entering HEIs. Real orphans are also being educated at the expense of the state. This year, about a thousand truly orphaned students were enrolled and they are being educated entirely at the expense of the state. At the same time, two thousand quotas have been allocated for low-income women. Quotas are also given to 500 women with five years of experience," said the deputy minister. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kameralar-shay-holatda" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
