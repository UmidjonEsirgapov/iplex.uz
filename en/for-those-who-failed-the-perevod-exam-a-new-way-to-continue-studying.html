                The most relevant news in the field of education today is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Category 2: Those who do not reach the passing score by more than 4.05 points Students in this category will be paid a minimum of 8 times to 25 times the price of a normal contract depending on the direction of the super-contract.</strong><br/><strong>For example, the passing score for the economics major. If it is 105 points, the student has scored 70 points.</strong><br/><strong>Important note: The super-contract price is the same for students who fall short of the passing score by more than 4.05 points and score more than 56.7 points.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Students who <strong>failed</strong> the Perevod exam now have two options to continue their studies.</p> <p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Continue studying at your current university.</p> <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> <strong>Transfer studies on the basis of a super-contract</strong>.</p> <p>Super-contract fees are divided into two categories:</p> <h3>Category 1: Students who do not reach the passing score of 4.05 points</h3> <p>To students of this category The price of a super-contract is determined on the basis of the following <strong>scale</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Those who do not reach 1.05 points - 1.5 times the amount of the normal payment contract;</li> <li>From 1.06 points to 2.05 points - 2 times;</li> <li>From 2.06 points to 3.05 points - 2.5 times;</li> <li>From 3.06 points Up to 4.05 points - 3 times.</li> </ul> <p><strong>For example, if 1.5 points are not enough in mathematics, the applicant pays 2 times for the super-contract. If the price of a regular contract is 7,400,000 soums, then the amount of the super-contract will be <strong>14.8 million soums</strong> (2x7,400,000).</strong></p> <h3>Category 2: Those who failed to reach the passing score by more than 4.05 points</h3> <p>Depending on the direction of the price of the super-contract, students of this category will receive at least 8 times of the regular contract It is paid up to 25 times.</p> <p><strong>For example,</strong> if the passing score for economics is 105 points, the student scored 70 points. If the minimum super-contract is set as 10 times and the price of a regular contract is 10,500,000 soums, then the amount of the super-contract will be <strong>105 million soums</strong> (10 x 10,500,000). students who have scored points will have the same super-contract price. For example, both less than 5 points and less than 50 points pay the same. Therefore, it is not useful to ask how many points are not enough.</p> <h3>Category 3: those who scored less than 56.7 points</h3> <p>The amount of super-muper contract for students in this category requires payment of 2 times the fee of those in category 2.</p> <p><strong>For example,</strong> if a student has scored 40 points and the minimum super-contract If it is 105 million soums, then he will pay <strong>210 million soums</strong> (2 x 105,000,000). — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/imtihonga-oid-muddatlar-barcha-abituriyentlar-saqlab-oling" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
