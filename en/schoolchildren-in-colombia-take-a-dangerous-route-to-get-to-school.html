Younger children are not allowed on the cable car, so they go to school with their parents or older siblings. Otherwise, children have to walk two hours through the rainforest to get to school.</p> <h3>Hard way to learn</h3> <p>Going to school is a real challenge for children in Colombia. Crossing steel wires is not only dangerous, but also physically difficult. Children need the help of their parents or older siblings to overcome this path.</p> <h3>What is your way of acquiring knowledge?</h3> <p>This question should make each of us think. Compared to the educational challenges children in Colombia face, our conditions are often more favorable. So, are our excuses for not seeking knowledge really an excuse? — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ixtisoslashtirilgan-maktab-va-maktab-internatlariga-hujjatlar-topshirish-muddati-va-imtihon-fanlari-malum-boldi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p>
