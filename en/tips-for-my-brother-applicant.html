                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>First of all, work hard.</strong><br/><strong>(Or if you can't get into the study, you will drop out) 6.</strong><br/><strong>Forget about social networks, weddings and birthdays, they are not for you.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>1. </strong>First of all, increase your effort. Aim big, don't be afraid! Act accordingly and live with purpose!</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Fill your surroundings with people who are similar in purpose and action to you. </p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Consult your parents, teachers and friends about which university to apply to, but make the final decision yourself. Take responsibility.</p> <p><strong>4. </strong>If you hang yourself, let everyone see your body on a high gallows! (Apply to the best university in your field of interest)</p> <p><strong>5. </strong>Forget Gulchehra, who is preparing with you! Concentrate on your studies. Anyway, he will touch Eshmat until you find money and send a matchmaker. (Or if you can't study, you will leave)</p> <p><strong>6. </strong>Always compete with the best, when they don't sleep you don't sleep, when they don't eat you don't eat, never rest when they work.</p> <p><strong>7. </strong>Don't pay attention to defeats along the way. They make you stronger. Learn to get up after you fall.</p> <p><strong>8.</strong> Forget about social networks, weddings and birthdays, they are not for you.</p> <p><strong>9.</strong> Don't try to interpret even the simplest things for fear of losing time! If your goal is higher, fall down and get ready again, believe me, you will definitely enter next year! </p> <p><strong>10.</strong> Don't say that I will start praying after I become a student! This is the talk of lazy people and excuses! This will bring you closer to your Lord.</p> <p><strong>11. </strong>If possible, study abroad or study at foreign universities in Uzbekistan. If you have a choice between studying and not studying, you can study at local universities (at least you will learn about life).</p> <p><strong>12.</strong> Think carefully, do you need 4 years of university for your chosen field?! If there are modern professions (IT, SMM, etc.), it doesn't take 4 years to learn and work in 6 months. </p> <p><strong>13.</strong> Get the blessings of your parents and teachers. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/janubiy-afrika-respublikasidagi-universitetga-kiraverishda-shunday-sozlar-yozib-qoyilgan" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
