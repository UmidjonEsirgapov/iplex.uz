                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Is higher education absolutely free in Germany?</strong><br/><strong>However, students are required to pay a semester fee.</strong><br/><strong>That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Posting purpose:</strong></p> <p>Through this post, we will consider one of the <strong>masters</strong> courses taught in English for free at <strong>University of Bayreuth</strong> in Germany and the application process.</p> <p><strong>Is higher education in Germany </strong><strong>absolutely</strong><strong> free?</strong></p> <p>To all of us. It is known that Germany is one of the few countries where higher education is free for national and international students. In addition, it is considered one of the most developed countries in the world. It is natural for any person to have the desire to study in Germany at least once. Now the question arises, "Is education in Germany really completely free?" <u><strong>The answer is "Yes and No".</strong></u> I will try to give a full explanation below for the answer.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong></p> <p>Most universities in Germany (national and government funded) do not charge students a tuition fee. But students are required to pay the semester fee. The cost of the semester fee may vary from one university to another, but in most universities the amount of this fee does not exceed 250 euros per semester. We can say that education in Germany is free because it is not a big amount and this fee is charged for administrative work done by the university for the student. But not all universities in Germany are absolutely free. As an example, we can take universities in the cities that are part of the German <strong>Baden-Wurttemberg</strong> region. These universities have started demanding tuition fees from international students for some courses from the 2017/18 academic year. That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany. But education in most universities is free, as we said above.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Education in Germany through English:</strong></p> <p>As in many developed countries, German universities offer courses taught in English. Although the number of such courses for the bachelor's degree is significantly less than for the master's level, this does not mean that there are none at all. Today we will talk about the <strong>University of Bayreuth</strong>, which offers such a master's course, and the procedure for sending documents for one of the master's courses it offers.</p> <p><strong>Brief about the University of Bayreuth:</strong></p> <p>The University of Bayreuth (originally called the German Universität Bayreuth) was founded in 1975 as a national research university in Bayreuth, Germany. The university ranks among the top 100 young international universities.</p> <p><img alt="See the source image" src="https://www.uni-bayreuth.de/de/universitaet/presse/images/2020/056-rw-low.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>Course offered:</strong></p> <ul> <li>History &amp; Economics (Master of Arts). <p><strong>Dates for sending documents:</strong></p> <p>Currently, the period for accepting documents for the winter semester of the university has not yet opened. Admission for international students <strong>will continue until July 15 for the winter semester of 2021.</strong></p> <p><strong>Required documents:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Bachelor's diploma (translated into English) - to study in this program, you must have completed studies at the bachelor's level in history, economics or a related field;</li> <li>Copy of passport;</li> <li>IELTS (at least 5.5) or other equivalent international certificates;</li> <li>Motivation letter;</li> <li>College or high school diploma (translated form in English).</li> </ol> <p>Applications should be sent to:</p> <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"> <li>eh@uni-bayreuth.de</li> </ul> <p><strong>Details here</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kech-qolmaslik-uchun-bularni-bajaring" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education..</li></ul>
