                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>This is a big mistake.</strong><br/><strong>📌 For this, subscribe to Mentalaba.uz's Telegram channels - you will be the first to know about the latest news.</strong><br/><strong>And Mentalaba.uz will be your closest assistant in this process.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>The most responsible stage of secondary school is the 11th grade. Because this year your future path will be decided. All students have the same dream: to pass the exam successfully and become a 100% student. But to achieve this, it is necessary to start proper preparation now, not only in the last month.</p> <p>We will list the most important steps for you below:</p> <h3>1. Determine your goal</h3> <p>First of all, you need to know what field you want to study. Do you want to be a doctor? Or a programmer? Maybe an economist? If the goal is unclear, the preparation will be confusing. Therefore, "Which direction should I study?" find the answer to the question.</p> <h3>2. Choose a subject and study deeply</h3> <p>General knowledge of all subjects is important when preparing for DTM or university exams, but focus more on core subjects. For example:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">For medicine - biology and chemistry.</li> <li aria-level="1">For engineering - mathematics and physics.</li> <li aria-level="1">For economics - mathematics and English.</li> </ul> <p>Remember the rule: the most points in the exam come from your major.</p> <h3>3. Follow a daily plan</h3> <p>Read a little bit every day. Studying 5-6 hours in one day and then resting for the next 3 days will not give good results. On the contrary, regular preparation for 2-3 hours every day is more effective.</p> <h3>4. Work with tests</h3> <p>Just studying theory is not enough. Tests should become a habit every day.</p> <p>📌 "Tests section" on the Mentalaba.uz platform will help you for this. Here you can take tests from various subjects, check your knowledge level and work on your mistakes.</p> <h3>5. Learn from mistakes</h3> <p>Every wrong answer is an opportunity. Review where you went wrong on the test. If you don't understand the first time, read it a second time, a third time. As a result, mistakes are reduced, and knowledge is strengthened.</p> <h3>6. Think about universities now</h3> <p>Most applicants only think about which university to apply to after the exam. In fact, it is very important to make a choice now.</p> <p>📌 Through the "University Department" on Mentalaba.uz, you can familiarize yourself with various higher education institutions in Uzbekistan and abroad and choose the one that suits you.</p> <h3>7. Don't forget a healthy lifestyle</h3> <p>Many students are only devoted to the book and shorten their sleep. This is a big mistake. Because for the brain to work well:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">enough sleep,</li> <li aria-level="1">do sports,</li> <li aria-level="1">proper nutrition is very important.</li> </ul> <h3>8. Be aware of the news</h3> <p>There are frequent changes in the education system. It is a big risk to be unaware of exam dates, admission procedures, new opportunities.</p> <p>📌 For this, subscribe to Mentalaba.uz's Telegram channels - this way you will be the first to know about the latest news.</p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>As an 11th grade student, you still have time. But don't waste this time. Determine your goal, prepare regularly, make a habit of taking tests, get to know universities now and keep up to date with the news. Mentalaba.uz will be your closest assistant in this process. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oliygoh/toshkent-davlat-transport-universiteti" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p>
