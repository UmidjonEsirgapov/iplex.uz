These grants will be paid for 4 years until the end of the study period. President Shavkat Mirziyoyev announced this during his speech at the youth forum in Tashkent. Starting next year, the President's grant will be introduced for 200 young people who scored the highest points in the entrance exams to higher education institutions. If the existing Presidential scholarship is intended for only one academic year, this grant will be paid for four years," said the head of state.</strong></p> <p>Furthermore, starting from the next academic year, Presidential and state scholarships will be introduced for undergraduate students of foreign higher educational institutions in the republic.</p> <p>"Because the young people studying in such educational institutions are also our children. They will serve for the development of our country tomorrow. Therefore, I think it will be fair if we take care of them and encourage their talent.</p> <p>In order to support our talented young people who have chosen the path of science, starting from next year, we will double the quota of Presidential Scholarships for master's and doctoral degrees. I am sure that the builders of the new Renaissance foundations will receive such opportunities and privileges first," the head of state said. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/xorijiy-va-nodavlat-otmdan-oqishni-davlat-universitetiga-faqat-yozda-kochirish-mumkin" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p>
