                Today's most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Because training centers are now delivering graduates with the skills and qualifications that the market demands.</strong><br/><strong>This is not because of a decline in interest, they got the knowledge they wanted at that time and thought that we better continue our startups. </strong><br/><strong>Students start leaving universities from the second and third years.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Professor Azamat Akbarov, executive director of the "Boursa National" company <strong>stressed that it is wrong to keep students in the university for four years, and made a proposal to change the universities to 3 years.</strong></p> <p>"One thing must be understood, by 2030 The tasks and goals of universities will change completely. For example, by that time, ordinary educational centers can become universities. Because educational centers are now supplying graduates with the skills and qualifications required by the market. teaching this field to a person in 6 months and providing him with a job ready for one and a half thousand dollars. When a student sees this situation, he begins to think, <strong>why should I study</strong>. Since the 1980s and 90s, the number of American students dropping out has increased. For example, the founders of IBM, Apple, and WhatsApp dropped out of the university from the second or third year. They got the knowledge they wanted during that time and thought that we should continue our startups. Soon, this tradition will reach us. Students will start leaving the universities from the second and third year. Because we live in a knowledge-based society the center was universities. Now the poles are changing," said Azamat Akbarov. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oliygoh/jizzax-politexnika-instituti" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
