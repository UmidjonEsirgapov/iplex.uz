                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>If the responsible employee considers your chosen subjects to be reasonable and agrees, he will have to sign the agreement (Learning Agreement) that the credits obtained during the course of studying at a foreign university will also be recognized at the local university. you will have to pay for it yourself.</strong><br/><strong>What are the biggest challenges to study as a Free Mover?</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Free Mover student exchange program – study abroad for 1 semester or 1 year</strong></p> <p><strong>What is this program?</strong><br/>The program provides students with a student exchange agreement between their home university and foreign universities even if not, it gives the opportunity to study at a foreign university for 1 semester or 1 year.</p> <p><strong>Is it possible to study at any university as a Free Mover?</strong><br/>No. Several countries have universities that accept Free Movers. You can study at those universities for 1 semester/1 year.</p> <p><strong>How can I participate in the program?</strong><br/>The process of going to study at a foreign university as a Free Mover is as follows:</p> <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Choose the university that suits you from the list of universities. Almost every participating university site has a dedicated page for Free Movers.</p> <p><strong>Step 2. </strong>Write an email to the contact shown on the university's Free Movers page. In the email, you can introduce yourself, your interest in studying at the university as a Free Mover for 1 semester/1 year, the application process and the list of required documents. Such information is usually provided on the page. But it is better to write an email and confirm again. When you receive the answer, you will go to the next step.</p> <p><strong>Step 3.</strong> See the responsible officer in the international department of your university. Tell him that you intend to study as a Free Mover for 1 semester/1 year at your chosen university. In the conditions of Uzbekistan, it can be quite difficult to get permission for this from local universities. Because the 1 semester/1 year you studied abroad and your grades will have to be recognized by the local university. In order for the received education to be recognized both at a local university and at a foreign university, it is necessary to find a direction where the subjects you studied, are studying and are studying are the same as possible.</p> <p><strong>Step 4. </strong>Select required courses/subjects from foreign university after getting approval from local university. They usually send you a list of such courses when they reply to your email. If not, request again.</p> <p>Once you have chosen the course/subjects you want, talk to the person who gives permission for you to go abroad as a Free Mover at your university (usually the international department is responsible, you can ask the international department). Show the staff your chosen course and subjects and explain that they are compatible with the curriculum subjects taken at your local university. If the responsible officer considers your chosen subjects reasonable and agrees, he will have to sign an agreement (Learning Agreement) on the recognition of the credits obtained in the process of studying at a foreign university at the local university. This agreement is made between the local university, the foreign university and the student.</p> <p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Complete the necessary documents for the foreign university and submit them. If you're accepted, start preparing to graduate!</p> <p><strong>Step 6. </strong>When you return from studying abroad, submit all your grades (Transcript of Records) to your local university. Based on the Learning Agreement, the university will convert (adjust and accept) the grades obtained during your study abroad to local university grades.</p> <p><strong>Are there any financial benefits during your study abroad? If you want to study abroad as a Free Mover, you will have to pay the contract amount yourself at the university of your choice. You also have to cover travel, living and other expenses yourself.</strong></p> <p><strong>What are the biggest challenges to studying as a Free Mover?</strong></p> <p><strong>These challenges are:</strong></p> <p>1. Consent of the local university.</p> <p>2. The consent of your chosen foreign university to accept you.</p> <p>3. Cost issues.</p> <p><strong>If I have a problem, who can I ask for advice?</strong><br/>For problems not related to your costs, you can contact the site specially created for Free Movers. The administration of the site provides advice on problems related to the permission of universities.</p> <p style="text-align: right;"><strong><em>Maqsud Salomov</em></strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qonunchilikda-oqituvchi-va-murabbiylar-uchun-qanday-imtiyozlar-belgilangan" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
