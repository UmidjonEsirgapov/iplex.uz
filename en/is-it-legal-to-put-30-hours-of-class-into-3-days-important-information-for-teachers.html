                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>If you are thinking about how to divide your working time and class hours as a teacher, this article will be important for you.</strong><br/><strong>According to Article 184 of the Labor Code, a teacher working at the same rate should work 36 hours a week and more than 6 hours a day. </strong><br/><strong>If you spread 30 hours of classes over 3 days, you will have to work 18 hours a day, which is not only illegal, but also physically taxing. The question arises: Is it legal to spend 30 hours of classes on 3 days and rest on the remaining three days? <p><strong>According to Article 184 of the Labor Code</strong>, a teacher working at the same rate must teach 36 hours a week and no more than 6 hours a day. This means that, taking into account the teacher's pedagogical workload and other duties, it is not legally correct to distribute 30 hours of lessons over 3 days and leave the rest of the days off. This download includes the educational process, methodological support, and organizational and pedagogical tasks. If you put 30 hours of classes in 3 days, you have to work 18 hours a day, which is not only outside the legal norms, but also physically burdensome.</p> <p><strong>At the same time, if in an educational institution</strong> 30 hours of classes are placed in 3 days, this will lead to a violation of the law. If such cases are detected by the state authorities, measures of responsibility may be taken against the school administration. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oqituvchilarni-videoga-olib-ijtimoiy-tarmoqlarga-tarqatganlik-uchun-javobgarlik-bor" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.</strong>
