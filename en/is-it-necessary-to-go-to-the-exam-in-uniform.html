Let's clarify this question based on official sources.</p> <h3>Coming in uniform is recommended, but not mandatory</h3> <p>❌ No, it is not necessary to come in uniform! In accordance with the procedure established by the State Testing Center (DTM), applicants wearing a special uniform is <strong>not a mandatory requirement</strong>, but is <strong>recommended</strong>.</p> <h3>Why is a uniform recommended?</h3> <p>The reason for this is that the test exams are held in public places with the participation of many people.

In previous years, our women and girls have participated in the tests in headscarves or hijab without any problems.
