                Today's most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>And I got into 5 universities this year alone. then apply.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Tell me a little about yourself?</strong></p> <p>I am Tashbotirov Azamat Uktamovich, I was born in 1999 in Pakhtachi district of Samarkand region, I graduated from vocational college in 2018 and in 2021 I became a student of Widener University of America on a grant basis. And this year I entered 5 universities</p> <p><strong>Why did you decide to study abroad for a bachelor's degree? Why did you choose the program you are studying? </strong></p> <p>After graduating from college, I became very interested in business and IT, and I set myself the task of studying abroad. My current specialty is International Business and this is the most important direction for me. Because it is possible to create a new trade cycle through business, my main goal is to bring new economic changes to my country.</p> <h2><strong>How much is the grant? </strong></h2> <p>The total grant amount is $88,000. Widener University Scholarship $20,000 per academic year for 4 years. The second grant amount is relatively less Global Development Scholarship allocates $2,000 per year and this is for 4 years. What are the admission requirements? Please elaborate on the strategies you used to apply. </p> <p>In general, admission to American universities is not difficult if you meet all the requirements. Usually, a response letter will be received within 1 month after the application is submitted. But most universities charge an application fee of around $70. But Widener University does not charge an application fee, only a $400 deposit upon enrollment. The following documents are required for admission:</p> <ul> <li>Online application</li> <li>Language certificate (IELTS)</li> <li>Motivation essay</li> <li>Recommendation letter from teacher</li> <li>Diploma and grades</li> <li>CV</li> </ul> <p>And other documents. My strategy was to not miss the deadline and keep in touch with the university.</p> <p><strong>Also, how many and to which universities did you submit your documents? How many accepted you and how many did you get rejected? What criteria did you use to select the programs you submitted? </strong></p> <p>Collection of documents is the main part of winning a grant. In 2020, for the first time, I entered the University of the People, where tuition is free, and I was given $1200. Uopeople is the first free online university in America and the world. After getting IELTS 6.5 in September, I started to try foreign universities. My first attempt was successful, and later I applied to more than 5 universities, most of them in the USA and England. But I haven't received any rejection yet. The universities I entered; Beloit College, Widener University, Uopeople, Swansea University, Synergy University and others are waiting to hear back. I chose business or IT in almost all of them.</p> <p><strong>How many grant places were allocated to the program you graduated from? Why do you think they chose you? </strong></p> <p>Grant places are not known, but this grant is given for a partial contract. And the university accepts the most potential, excellent and knowledgeable students. I think they chose me because I have high academic results. My college grades are all perfect (5), I have a phone certificate and a perfect essay. I also consider my work experience to be the main part of my winning a grant.</p> <p><strong>What practical advice can you give to our subscribers who want to study abroad and win a grant like you? What to start with? What should be paid attention to? What documents are required? </strong></p> <p>I advise our students who want to study abroad to pay attention to the rating of the university and the contract amount. Because most of them are very expensive, from $15 to $40,000 for a year. Calculate all the financing costs, then prepare your documents. Basic documents; IELTS (6 points), college or university diploma with attachment (English translation), ACT, SAT certificates, resume, CV, etc. Apply when all are exhausted. Pay attention to the fact that the application dates are limited.</p> <h2><strong>What should you pay attention to when filling out a motivation letter and CV? </strong></h2> <p>A cover letter is an essay of between 450 and 600 words. In the motivational letter, you will write about yourself, your family background, your education and why you are applying to the requested university. I recommend that you save your essay in word, because you will write it by hand on the website in a certain time. A CV is a short reference about yourself. The CV letter will be better if it is perfectly written. I filled out both 1 month ago before applying. Make sure that both letters do not contain any false information. If so, your application will not be considered.</p> <p><strong>What are your near-term plans? </strong></p> <p>The plan is clear, to study in America. But I'm still waiting for a reply from the rest of the universities because I've applied for several more grants. In the next two months, I will find out which university will start studying in September. Widener University is one of the most convenient options. I wish everyone good luck, thank you for the interesting conversation!</p> <p style="text-align: right;"><em>Otabek Akromov spoke</em> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oliygoh/oʻzbekiston-xalqaro-islomshunoslik-akademiyasi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think of this news?
