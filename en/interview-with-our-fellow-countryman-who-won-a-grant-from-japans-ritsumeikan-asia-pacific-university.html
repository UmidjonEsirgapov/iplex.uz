                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>First of all, because I want to become one of the leading experts by learning in the best educational institution in my field, under the hands of experienced teachers.</strong><br/><strong>100% grant is given to only 1 person per academic year.</strong><br/><strong>In any grant program. that's it.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>- Peace be upon you, Ulugbekmirza. Please tell me a little about yourself.</strong></p> <p>- Hello. My name is Ulugbekmirza Abdurahmanov. I am 22 years old. I was born in Kosonsoi district, Namangan region. I am currently a 3rd year student at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Japan. I am studying Marketing.</p> <p><strong>- General information about your current university.</strong></p> <p>- APU was ranked among the top 10 private universities in the latest "QS Asia University Rankings 2022". APU is among the Top 3 Universities for International Students, Top 5 for Inbound Exchange and Top 30 for International Faculty. Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University is a member of the Ritsumeikan Trust, which includes APU, Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto and Lake Biwa, and elementary and middle schools throughout Japan. In the early 1990s, the concept of establishing an international university in Beppu was first mooted by Morihiko Hiramatsu, governor of Oita Prefecture, through Mr. Kawamoto, then chancellor of the Ritsumeikan Trust in Kyoto. The university was established in April 2000 in Jumonjibaru, north of Beppu.</p> <p>The university was founded on the ideals of "freedom, peace, humanity, international understanding and the future shape of the Asia Pacific region". The university's slogan "Shape your world" was created in 2008 to evoke the image of students from all over the world who come to rediscover themselves and the world.</p> <p>As for the university's education system, there are two four-month semesters per academic year. A semester is divided into two quarters of seven weeks each. Unlike many other universities, students are admitted and graduated twice a year, in the spring and fall. APU offers undergraduate education in the liberal arts, including media studies, languages, and traditional Japanese arts. Students choose their own subjects and are not limited to classes in their specialty. However, students can choose the courses of their respective study programs only depending on the year of study.</p> <p><strong>- Why did you decide to study </strong><strong>bachelor level abroad?</strong></p> <p>- There are several reasons. First of all, because of my desire to become one of the leading experts in my field, learning from experienced teachers at the best educational institution. In addition, I intend to become a global citizen, not limited to a small circle. The atmosphere at APU, the team of international experts and students, and the quality of education help me a lot on this path.</p> <p><strong>- How did you win this university grant? How much is the scholarship amount? How many grants will be allocated?</strong></p> <p>- The university provided me with an 80% grant. Such a grant is awarded to 3 people out of about 6,000 candidates. That is, 80% of the tuition fee is covered. To win this grant, it is enough to submit all the required documents, write a unique motivational letter and essay, and successfully pass the interview. The university offers many grants for international students. The amount of scholarships is 30%, 50%, 65%, 80% and 100%. 100% grant is given to only 1 person per academic year. 80% for 3 people. 65% and other grants are awarded to relatively more students. The total evaluation of all submitted documents, the results of the interview and the results of the online assessment are taken into account when awarding the scholarship. The scholarship results will be announced together with the final results of the application submission. In addition, applicants who apply early will have more chances to receive APU tuition fee reduction scholarships.</p> <p><strong>- What should you pay attention to when writing motivational letters and essays, and during the interview process?</strong></p> <p>- The most important thing is to be "yourself". High-flying, back-and-forth talk will not help. The admissions committee mainly pays more attention to the candidate's future potential and passion for learning than his current knowledge. You should talk clearly and in detail about your plans, how you see your future, why you chose a particular field.</p> <p><strong>- Advantages and disadvantages of studying in Japan?</strong></p> <p>- If I talk about the advantages, first of all, I should note that the innovation of the Japanese people and the education system is based on this principle. Factors such as culture, mentality, international environment are also important. There are many opportunities and benefits for international students at APU. The university campus is located in the mountain resort zone. There are various circles, clubs, student associations. You can spend your free time meaningfully. Another thing I like the most is the respect for religions. Since I come from a religious family, this aspect is very important for me. Our university has a mosque for Muslim students and teachers. Special halal food is prepared for Muslims. Even special dishes are provided. This kind of attention is certainly satisfying.</p> <p>There are many opportunities even after starting to study at the university. There are many exchange programs and additional grants. I also won one such additional grant "Jasso honors scholarship". A certain amount of money is allocated to the holders of this grant every month. APU also provides 100% employment to its students. I have also been hired by one of the world's leading consulting companies.</p> <p><strong>- Wow, great. What advice can you give to our followers who, like you, want to study abroad and win a grant? What should I start with? What should you pay attention to?</strong></p> <p>- In addition to studying, it is important to pay attention to social activities. The level of language skills also plays a big role. (6+) And one more thing, you don't have to be perfect in every way. It is enough to show some of your strengths. They're not looking for the ideal candidate, but rather a passionate, qualified candidate. The same is true of any grant program. Start your application process by choosing the right program and university for you. Then you can study the list of required documents and prepare. And it is better if you apply to several universities in parallel, not just one. The requirements are almost the same everywhere. A person who works hard can achieve anything. I wish everyone good luck!</p> <p><strong>- Thank you for the meaningful conversation, Ulugbekmirza.
