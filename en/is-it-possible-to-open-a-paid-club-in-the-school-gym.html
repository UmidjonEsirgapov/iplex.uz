Recently, a sports trainer living in our neighborhood came and asked if we could open a paid boxing club in the school gym. Frankly, I did not know the procedure. If we open a paid club in the school gym itself, wouldn't we be doing something wrong?</p> <p><strong>Answer</strong></p> <p>It is possible to open paid sports clubs in the sports facilities of educational institutions. This is regulated by the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers dated February 2, 2019 No. 78 "On measures for the establishment of paid sports clubs in the sports facilities of state educational institutions". provided physical training and sports services are performed on a paid basis.</p> <p>Payments for the provision of paid services in sports facilities are made monthly no later than the 10th of the next month based on a contract concluded with the head of the educational institution. will be directed to the costs of utility bills of the sports facilities used by the sports facilities and the rest of the funds will be distributed in the following order:</p> <p><strong>50 percent - will be directed to strengthening the material and technical base of the sports facility;</strong></p> <p><strong>50 percent - will be paid to the trainer as a financial incentive according to the established procedure.</strong></p> <p>If two or more trainers provide paid services at the same time in sports facilities the amount of utility bills for sports facilities is distributed to each trainer in the same amount.</p> <p>The receipt of fees for paid services provided by each trainer and separate accounting for the payments paid to them is carried out in accordance with the procedure established by the accounting department of the relevant educational institution. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qirgizistonda-tahsil-olayotgan-talabalar-diqqatiga" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz website.
