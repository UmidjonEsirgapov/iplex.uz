He spoke about the need to have it.</p> <p>According to him, after the National Guard started to carry out preventive work in schools, it was found that <strong>124 thousand students did not come to school without reason</strong> in a short period of time. It is noted that 3,000 parents were fined under Article 47 of the Code of Administrative Responsibility.</p> <blockquote>"This punishment was almost never applied because there were no complaints.

The leader of "Milily Tikhilan" emphasized that all <strong>boys, except those who have graduated from school and are enrolled, should be drawn into one-year compulsory military service</strong> without payment. <strong>Atlas suits are not worn,</strong> boys and girls who know their worth develop.</p> <p>Kindergarten and school have become a matter of national security not only in Uzbekistan, but in the whole of Central Asia. It should be protected not only by the National Guard, but also by the whole society," he said. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/tasviriy-sanʼat-boyicha-respublika-tanlovi-goliblariga-qanday-imtiyozlar-belgilangan" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p>  <br/><br/>How do you feel about this news?
