Recently, such a modern "Astrum" IT academy started its activity in Tashkent region. This academy was created in the spirit of the idea of ​​the 42nd school. The opening of such an academy will create a wide range of opportunities for our youth.</p> <p>Many talented young people in Uzbekistan, but facing financial difficulties, have applied to study at this academy. In agreement with <strong>"Astrum"</strong> IT Academy, a grant was allocated to them, <strong>Microkreditbank and "Yoshlar-Kelajagimiz" fund</strong> also fully supported this initiative.</p> <p>It is for this purpose that they allocated 1,500,000,000 soums to each of 100 young people. A new project, providing up to 15 million soums of grants for studies, was announced in cooperation with Metsenat. To use this opportunity, you need to register through the @yoshlargrant_bot Telegram bot. Registration ends on November 1, 4. We hope that our young men and women who studied at this academy will one day become mature personnel who will implement large-scale projects on a global scale and leave their mark.
