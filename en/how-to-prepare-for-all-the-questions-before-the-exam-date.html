                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Suppose you need to prepare for tests with 1000 pages of information from subject 1 and 500 pages of information from subject 2, which are not read until the exam day.</strong><br/><strong>Then 12 pages from subject 1 and 6 pages from subject 2 every day for 3 months. You can make a plan so that you can prepare for information tests.</strong><br/><strong>A person with a plan will arrive on time for the exams, thinking that I need to study 2 pages more than before.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>For this, you need to follow 3 steps.</strong></p> <p><strong>1. See the reality.</strong></p> <p><strong>First of all:</strong>- you need to know what exactly you are not ready for- and how much time you have left.</p> <p>For example, now you have 3 months left. Write down on a piece of paper which aspects of the subjects that will be on the exam you are 100 percent prepared for, and which are not so much. Writing on paper can seem daunting. But it is difficult to make a plan while holding a lot of information in the brain at the same time, and you can easily make a plan by writing down as much information as you want on paper.</p> <p><strong>2. Make a plan.</strong></p> <p>Determine what you need to study every day from now until the exam date.</p> <p>Suppose you have 1000 pages of information from the 1st subject and 500 pages of information from the 2nd subject to be prepared for the tests. Then you can make a plan that every day for 3 months I will prepare 12 pages from the 1st subject and 6 pages from the 2nd subject. And in the last week, you will repeat all your knowledge.</p> <p><strong>3. Change your plan when it doesn't work.</strong></p> <p>No matter how well you plan, something will go wrong. Many people leave the plan thinking that there will be problems both with the plan and without the plan. There is a situation where there is a problem with the plan, but without a plan, it is impossible for you to make the right decision.</p> <p>Suppose you suddenly got sick for a week and could not read anything for 7 days. If you don't plan, you won't know you're 126 pages behind. You can only see it if you have a plan. Only when you see the problem can you find the right solution. A person without a plan walks thinking that one day he will catch up. A person with a plan will be on time for the exams, thinking that I need to study 2 pages more than before. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/mablaglaringizni-toylarga-emas-farzandingizga-investitsiya-qiling" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
