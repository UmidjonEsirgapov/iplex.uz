                The latest news in education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>For example, surpassing it by copying will only bring you joy at the time; Asking for help.</strong><br/><strong>Actually, your friend who is a competitor will repeat and strengthen his knowledge by teaching you.</strong><br/><strong>But it is not right to ask everything just because you need to ask.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2><strong>Competition. </strong></h2> <p>When choosing a competitor, it is useful to focus on our peers who are stronger than ourselves, or rather, experienced applicants. There is no point in constantly beating a weak applicant. When competing, we should try to defeat our opponent not by will, but by knowledge. For example, surpassing him by moving will only bring you joy at that moment;</p> <h2><strong>Ask for help. </strong></h2> <p>Your competitive friends are also your companions. Sharing experiences with them is the same term for you. In fact, your competitor friend will also repeat and strengthen their knowledge by teaching you. But it is not right to ask everything just because it is necessary to ask. It is necessary to use thinking in the places where it is necessary to think;</p> <h2><strong>The right choice. </strong></h2> <p>The main factor that turns most applicants into "experienced applicants" is failure to make the right choices. Do you have to enter a higher education institution in Tashkent with 195 points when the passing score in your field is 142 points in some region? Moreover, if you yourself are from that region. As long as studying in Tashkent is the primary issue, there are many places with low scores. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oqituvchilar-ish-vaqtini-hisobga-olish-tabeli-qanday-yuritiladi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
