                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>However, students are required to pay a semester fee.</strong><br/><strong>That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany. also offers courses taught in English.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Purpose of the post:</strong></p> <p>Through this post, we will take a look at one of the <strong>masters</strong> courses taught in English for free at <strong>Ulm University</strong> in Germany and the process of applying for it.</p> <p><strong>Higher education in Germany </strong><strong>Absolutely</strong><strong> free?</strong></p> <p>As we all know, German higher education is one of the few countries where higher education is free for national and international students. In addition, it is considered one of the most developed countries in the world. It is natural for any person to have the desire to study in Germany at least once. Now the question arises, "Is education in Germany really completely free?" <u><strong>The answer is "Yes and No".</strong></u> I will try to give a full explanation below for the answer.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong></p> <p>Most universities in Germany (national and government funded) do not charge students a tuition fee. But students are required to pay the semester fee. The cost of the semester fee may vary from one university to another, but in most universities the amount of this fee does not exceed 250 euros per semester. We can say that education in Germany is free because it is not a big amount and this fee is charged for administrative work done by the university for the student. But not all universities in Germany are absolutely free. As an example, we can take universities in the cities that are part of the German <strong>Baden-Wurttemberg</strong> region. These universities have started demanding tuition fees from international students for some courses from the 2017/18 academic year. That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany. But education in most universities is free, as we said above.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Education in Germany through English:</strong></p> <p>As in many developed countries, German universities offer courses taught in English. Although the number of such courses for the bachelor's degree is significantly less than for the master's level, this does not mean that there are none at all. Today, we will talk about the <strong>Ulm University</strong>, which offers such a master's course, and the procedure for sending documents for one of the master's courses it offers.</p> <p><strong>Ulm University in brief:</strong></p> <p>Ulm University was founded in 1967 as the "Ulm University of Medicine and Natural Sciences" and is the youngest state university in Baden-Württemberg. The university had approximately 10,000 students enrolled in the 2019/20 winter semester. The university is known for its close cooperation with companies that support the development of science in its surroundings.</p> <p><img alt="See the source image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Uniulmnord.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>Course offered:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Master of Science</li> </ul> <p><strong>Double degree:</strong></p> <ul> <li>For two degree options: Università degli Studi di Padova (University of Padova, Italy) University of Oulu (University of Oulu, Finland) has a partnership program</li> </ul> <p><strong>Curriculum language:</strong></p> <ul> <li>English</li> </ul> <p><strong>Duration:</strong></p> <ul> <li>4 semester</li> </ul> <p><strong>Curriculum fee:</strong></p> <ul> <li>The international student fee for studying in this course is 1500 euros per semester.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Dates for submitting documents:</strong></p> <p>The application period for the winter semester of the university is currently <strong>closed</strong> Admission for international students <strong>Continues until May 15 for the winter semester 2021.</strong></p> <p><strong>Required documents:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Bachelor's diploma (translated into English) - to study in this program, you must have studied at the undergraduate level in medicine or a related field;</li> <li>Copy of passport;</li> <li>IELTS (approx. 6.5 and above) or one of the other international certificates of the same level;</li> <li>Motivation letter;</li> <li>College or high school diploma (translated into English).</li> </ol> <p>Applications should be sent to:</p> <p>Ulm University<br/>Abt.
