Khudoyberdiyev explained that now state grants are not given for such and such a university, but are allocated for a field. For example, Tashkent State University of Law will not have a specific grant, but a general grant quota will be allocated for the field of jurisprudence.</p> <blockquote> <p>Among the applicants who applied to the field of jurisprudence in all higher educational institutions of the republic, those who <strong>scored the highest points within the quota</strong>, regardless of which higher education institution they applied to, will be included in the grant. This means that some higher education institutions may no longer have any students enrolled in the grant.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to the plan, a <strong>50% limit </strong> will be set for higher education institutions in order to prevent <strong>a single higher education institution from taking away the entire quota of the state grant.</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kelgusi-oquv-yilidan-faqat-davlat-granti-asosidagi-qabul-korsatkichlari-belgilanadi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
