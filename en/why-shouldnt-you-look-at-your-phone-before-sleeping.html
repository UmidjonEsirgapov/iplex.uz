                Today's most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>However, using the phone before going to bed can have negative consequences.</strong><br/><strong>The hormone melatonin regulates the body's sleep pattern, so spending a long time with the phone has a negative effect on the quality of sleep.</strong><br/><strong>And this, with the neck and spine. may cause related problems.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Phones have become an integral part of our daily life. However, using the phone before going to bed can have negative consequences. In this article, we will look at how looking at the phone screen before going to sleep can be harmful to your health.</p> <h3>Reasons Not to Look at the Phone</h3> <p>Using the phone before going to bed can cause several serious problems:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Eye strain:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Looking at the phone screen for a long time can damage your eyes. The eyeball loses its ability to adapt to the perception of near and far objects. This condition can lead to reduced vision.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sleep Disturbance:</strong></p> <ul> <li>The blue light from the phone screen reduces the production of the hormone melatonin, which causes disruption of natural biorhythms. The hormone melatonin regulates the body's sleep mode, so spending a long time with the phone has a negative effect on the quality of sleep.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Neck Pain:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Staying looking at the phone for a long time causes neck muscles to tighten and tire. Muscles that are stretched in the same position quickly get tired and pain occurs. This can cause neck and spine problems.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>Using the phone before going to bed has a negative impact not only on the quality of your sleep, but also on your overall health. To prevent problems such as blurred vision, sleep disorders and neck pain, put down the phone at least an hour before going to sleep and engage in other activities, such as reading a book or meditation. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/uxlama-abituriyent" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
