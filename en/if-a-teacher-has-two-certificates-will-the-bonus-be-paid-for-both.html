                The most relevant news in the field of education today is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>If a teacher has an internationally recognized certificate (for example, GMAT) and is given a 50 percent bonus, and he also has a national certificate, the procedure for calculating bonuses in this case is as follows: The highest bonus is paid: Paragraph 9 of the Presidential Decree, subparagraph "g" According to this, teachers with multiple certificates will be paid a bonus only for the certificate with the highest percentage.</strong><br/><strong>This means that if the international GMAT certificate allows for a 50% bonus, no additional bonus will be given for the national certificate.</strong><br/><strong>Conclusion: If a teacher holds both international and national certificates, only the additional bonus for the certificate that gives him the right to receive the highest bonus will be paid.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>If you, as a teacher, have several certificates, the issue of premium payment for them is regulated in accordance with paragraph 9 of the Decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. PF-134 of May 11, 2022. This decree provides for the granting of 20 percent bonuses to teaching staff based on the certificates obtained in the national evaluation system of the Knowledge and Skills Assessment Agency.</p> <p>If a teacher has an internationally recognized certificate (for example, <strong>GMAT</strong>) and is given a 50 percent bonus, and he also has a national certificate, the procedure for calculating bonuses in this case is as follows:</p> <p><strong>Highest bonus will be paid:</strong> According to paragraph 9 of the presidential decree, sub-paragraph "g", pedagogues with multiple certificates will be paid a bonus only for the certificate with the highest percentage. This means that if an international GMAT certificate gives you a 50% bonus, no additional bonus will be given for a national certificate.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you already have a GMAT certificate and are getting a 50% bonus based on that certificate, you will not receive an additional 20% bonus because you later get a national certificate. Bonuses are calculated only on the basis of the certificate that gives the highest bonus.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> If the teacher has international and national certificates, he will be paid additional bonus only according to the certificate that gives the right to receive the highest bonus. Therefore, in such cases, allowances are not combined. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qanday-holatda-kitob-oqish-qulay-va-barakali-boladi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p>
