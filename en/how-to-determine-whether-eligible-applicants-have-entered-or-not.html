                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>unfortunately, you cannot determine this yourself.</strong><br/><strong>The reason is that the site mandat.uzbmb.uz does not show what privileges applicants have (except for general information).</strong><br/><strong>For example, depending on the general list, which applicants are now women or you cannot find out if a recommendation for military service has been issued, which applicant has a disability, or who is a child of a military person. The reason is that the mandat.uzbmb.uz site does not show what privileges the applicants have (except for general information). <p>For example, looking at the general list, you cannot find out which applicant has been given a recommendation for women or military service, which applicant has a disability, or who is the child of a soldier. Even if you knew this, it would be impossible to calculate manually, for this you would have to open the personal page of hundreds of thousands of applicants. Because it takes a lot of time to calculate each privilege separately, check them one by one, remove them from the general list, and approve the mandate.</p> <p>It would be great if they made an inventory of more than 40 privileges, left only a few socially fair ones, and canceled all the others. But this is not the case yet, if the privilege is added, it is unlikely to decrease. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/8/8-sinf-informatika" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.</strong>
