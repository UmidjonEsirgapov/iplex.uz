                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was this:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>If you write an application and resign voluntarily, i.e. according to Article 160 of the Labor Code (MK), you will receive monetary compensation (Article 165 of the Labor Code), severance pay (Article 173 of the Labor Code), employment contract The average monthly salary from your previous place of employment will not be paid for 2-3 months after the cancellation (Article 100 of the Criminal Code). Also, according to Article 144 of the Criminal Code, the employer must offer the employee who has been laid off to another job that matches his specialty and qualifications, and in the absence of such a job, another job available to the employer.</strong><br/><strong>Muhammadamina Karimjonov: "Therefore, demand that the contract be canceled in accordance with Article 161, Part 2, Clause 2 of the Criminal Code, do not write an application on your own initiative." In addition, within 6 months from the date of dismissal of the employee, if there are vacancies in the organization in the same specialty and qualification that the employee previously held, the employer must rehire the employee who was dismissed due to downsizing. <h3>What are the rights of laid-off psychologists, librarians, and laboratory assistants?</h3> <p>It is known that due to the reduction in the positions of librarians, psychologists, and laboratory assistants in general education institutions, warning letters may have started to be issued to employees.</p> <p>In this article, you will find answers to the following questions about the rights of laid-off employees: Is it necessary to write an application without work?</p></strong> <li><strong>How can I get compensation for two months?</strong></li> <li><strong>Is severance pay granted?</strong></li> <li><strong>How can I get compensation for 3 months until December? In the chat, the expert on labor law <strong>Muhammadamin Karimjonov</strong> clarified these questions. <p><strong>The employer</strong> promises: "For now, write an application for the vacancy according to your wishes, and then I will hire you again." In this case, how will the <strong>2-month compensation</strong> and other money be paid?</p> <p>If you write an application and give notice of your own volition, i.e. according to <strong>Article 160 of the Labor Code (MK)</strong>, you will receive <strong>monetary compensation</strong> in accordance with the duration of the term (<strong>MK Article 165</strong>), <strong>severance pay</strong> (<strong>Article 173 of the Civil Code</strong>), <strong>for 2-3 months</strong> after the termination of the employment contract, the average monthly salary from your previous workplace (<strong>Article 100 of the Civil Code</strong>) will not be paid. Don't fall for false promises! If you have been laid off, don't write an application, ask to cancel the employment contract in accordance with Article 161, Clause 2." Only when these reasons exist, the court finds that there has actually been a change in the number of employees or the volume of work.</p> <p>Also, according to <strong>Article 144 of the Civil Code</strong>, the employer must offer the employee who has been laid off to another job that matches his specialty and qualifications, and in the absence of such a job, another job available to the employer.</p> <p><strong>Attention!</strong> <strong>Before canceling an employment contract</strong>, if the collective agreement provides for the prior consent of the trade union committee to cancel the contract or the collective labor contract at the initiative of the employer, it is necessary to obtain the consent of the trade union committee in accordance with <strong>Article 164</strong> of the Labor Code.</p> <p><strong>Muhammadamin Karimjonov</strong>: Request cancellation according to Article 161, Part 2, Clause 2, do not write an application on your own initiative. "In addition, if within 6 months from the date of dismissal of the employee who has been laid off, there are vacant (vacant) positions in the organization in the same specialty and qualification previously held by the employee, the employer shall not be dismissed. must re-employ the dismissed employee. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ozbekistonda-hamshiralar-akademiyasi-tashkil-etiladi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p></strong></li>
