                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>What will be the tradition this year?</strong><br/><strong>You try.</strong><br/><strong>You must succeed.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>There are 6 months left to prepare for the tests of higher educational institutions. This time can be spent usefully, it can be spent completely useless. In the series "<strong>Harmful advice</strong>r" we will talk about a way to pass the time. <strong>Whoever correctly understands these tips - smiles, draws conclusions</strong> and prepares properly for the exam using the basics in the material.</p> <p><strong>Reputability and the advice of a true friend are criteria for choosing a university and faculty</strong></p> <p>Which university did your acquaintances decide to enter? You should also submit it there. Even if you didn't dream about this profession, it doesn't matter, after all, the main thing is to be with friends, and everything is easy for friends. The prestige of one or another direction can be another reason - this should not be overlooked either. everyone wanted to be an engineer, doctor, or teacher. Then came the era of managers, universities produced them in huge numbers. The recent managers had nothing to manage and most of them had to change professions. Later, architects, journalists, economists, lawyers, designers and IT specialists became a tradition. Everyone wanted to study in these directions. What will be the tradition this year? Do you already know? Do not listen to your heart, move forward according to tradition! It is never too late to get the second or third information because of the mistake made in choosing the first information.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>We do not take into account the issue of psychological preparation</strong></p> <p>It is no secret that even with excellent knowledge of the subject, you can fail the exam. Stress, lack of sleep, inability to control one's emotions and trusting the time given for answers can make a bitter joke even with those who have received a "red" certificate or diploma. Testing applicants is such a situation. It is better to ignore this aspect and just do not think about it. Whatever happens. Not to mention the fact that there are software products available to help applicants learn how to deal with stress and take the time allotted for the test. Don't pay attention to this information, it is triple useful and proven by experience, why fly someone's advertisement.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Let's make machetes and practice hiding and moving them around</strong></p> <p><img src="https://wallbox.ru/wallpapers/main/201643/mathematics-machetes-cheating-copying.jpg"/></p> <p>Relying on mattresses is certainly the most ridiculous exercise, but it's still worth a try. It's okay if many people like you have been exposed and disgraced from testing. You try. These unfortunates did not know how to use them. You must succeed. The most difficult task here is to determine what to write on the sheets, because when the knowledge of the subject is very shallow, all the writings can form a separate library. Write extremely large texts with extremely small fonts in a very thin pen. If you can't read them, there's nothing to be afraid of, after all, you won't have to read them during the exam. It doesn't matter if you have done poorly in school or college in recent years, you can make up for it in the last three days. After all, in history, there were students who prepared for the Chinese language exam on the last night, and you don't pass Chinese, you pass an 11-year educational program of <strong>only 5 subjects</strong> (2 core, 3 compulsory). Therefore, start training seriously only three days before the test.</p> <p>During this period, you will not eat or drink, but you will sit down and drink the knowledge. It is better not to sleep at all on the last night, and it is better to come to the exam feeling very nervous or apathetic and indecisive and pass the test in such a state. That's when you will notice that it was not possible to master what was lost during the past years in three days and nights, and that it is far from reality to take out the prepared bedspread, it would not help. Now it remains to hope for luck and roughly choose the answers from the proposed options.</p> <p><img src="https://portal.edu.asu.ru/pluginfile.php/644534/course/overviewfiles/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0.jpg"/></p> <p> no one follows the advice, but does the exact opposite. The applicant who is reading this text will carefully approach the choice of profession, prepare himself carefully for entering studies, be in the right psychological mood, prepare enough for the exam and come to pass it relying only on his knowledge.</p> <p><strong>We wish you luck in preparing for higher educational institutions!</strong></p> <p><strong>Saida J</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/maktab-bitiruvchilariga-bogchada-ishlashga-ruxsat-beriladi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p>
