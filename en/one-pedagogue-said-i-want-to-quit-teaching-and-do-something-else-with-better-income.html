                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>"We give our children our love, soul, all our knowledge, our nerves, our health.</strong><br/><strong>But in the end, we hear a grateful saying: "You should not think about increasing the salary, but about increasing the quality of education."</strong><br/><strong>General Prosecutor's Office the teacher reported that she was beaten up by a female colleague and the suspect was caught. But in the end, we hear a grateful saying, "You should think about improving the quality of education, not about increasing the salary," says a teacher who teaches elementary school students. The teacher from Syrdarya teaches 20 hours a day, supervises the class, and receives 3,700,000 soums as a salary. The teacher writes on his Twitter page that he is thinking about leaving the teaching profession. <blockquote> <p> "Even though you receive a monthly salary, you have a headache: what will I spend this money on? You are confused about how to distribute the money that has increased from utility bills, loans, and monthly payments," the teacher writes. shrinks or immediately tears, wears out, eats something, hiccups, spins, besides, you have to pay for everyday expenses every day. You don't have enough money to provide for what you want.</p> <p>You want to visit your mother, give her something, eat whatever she wants, but your heart breaks when you look at the small amount of money in your pocket.</p> <p>Your child hurts, you feel sick, you cry, but you think about going to the doctor, you can't afford it, my conscience is in front of my children. It's difficult.</p> <p>I'm also forgetting the habits of women: I stopped dreaming about beautiful clothes and jewelry, I just said, "Go ahead, I'll wear this all the time." I can't stop telling my children to be patient.</p> <p>Thanks to the treatment, I reduced my expenses again and managed to pay off debt. Sometimes my child rebels: "when will our house be finished, when will we invite guests, my friends, that's it, that's it." On that day, an acquaintance of mine who works in a bank said: "My husband earns 14 million monthly, excluding bonuses." I am a high-class teacher and I work for 4 months for this salary. Is this a respect for the teacher, a response to his work?" - he sighs.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>How can you expect results from a person who lives in so many shortcomings?</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>"Have you ever taught a 6-7 year old child? Do you know how hard it is to teach and educate a child? We give our love, soul, all our knowledge, our nerves, our health to several children.</p> <p>But in the end, we hear a grateful saying, "You should think about improving the quality of education, not about increasing the salary." Where are we lacking from other industry workers? Is our work so worthless? How can you expect results from a person who lives in so many shortcomings?</p> <p>If you talk a lot, your heart hurts only... What is the percentage of teachers who receive a high salary out of the total number of teachers? Why isn't everyone's salary increased at once?</p> <p>I don't know, people don't even want to work. If you say you leave, you feel sorry for the hard work, if you say no, your head aches every day wondering where I will get money...", wrote the teacher who ended his trend.</p> </blockquote> <p>We remind you that on April 18, a video showing two female teachers being beaten up in one of the schools in Surkhandarya was spread on the Internet. This incident happened in school 31 in Uzun district. The Prosecutor General's Office reported that a female teacher was beaten by a colleague and the minister of preschool and school education, Hilola Umarova, said that the situation was "very sad" and that the two women teachers were under supervision. For information, in the draft constitutional law, the provisions on teaching staff have been revised and a new article has been introduced, which stipulates respect for the teaching profession and their social protection. <br/><br/>How did this news affect you? — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/khalifa-university-scholarships-2022-uae-fully-funded-xalifa-fan-va-texnologiya-univeristetida-toliq-grant-hamda-2200-stipendiya" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p></strong>
