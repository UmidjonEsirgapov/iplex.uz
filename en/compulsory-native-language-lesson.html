Therefore, while you are studying and writing on the Internet for fun (as if you are writing an essay at school), write incorrectly:</p> <p>"<em>When are we going to wawlu yeyw</em>", not "<em>When are we going to eat shashlik?</em>"<br/>"<em>I have something to do with a girl, get my coat</em>", not "<em>Girls, I have news. I bought a new dress</em>"</p> <p>This will help you remember the correct spelling of words faster. IELTS recommends that you write something in English to improve your writing. But you don't make mistakes when you write in English, it's the same thing. </p> <p>After taking IELTS, many people stop practicing writing in English. You also want to do it in your native language. stop writing nonsense after the exam.</p> <p>"<strong>But you don't understand one thing. If I write so intelligently with my friends, I will look strange to them, you can say. But ask yourself a question: if you don't get into the study, people will laugh at you because you wrote correctly: "<strong>You didn't get into the study because I laughed at you. I will take all the blame</strong>", - will they say?</strong></p> <p>Would you give up the path leading to your goals because of the opinion of these people? Should there be people in front of you who respect the path leading to your goals or those who despise it?</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Avalboyev Sukhrob</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/attestatsiya-imtihonlari-otkaziladigan-joy-manzillari" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
