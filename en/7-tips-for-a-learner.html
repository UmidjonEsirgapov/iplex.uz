                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Then you will not have difficulties in the future.</strong><br/><strong>These are: Aqidah, Physics, Arithmetic, Biology.</strong><br/><strong>Those who can explain the most simply are those who understand the subject best.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>1. First of all, start with fundamental (basic) knowledge. Then you will not suffer in the future. These are: Faith, Physics, Arithmetic, Biology. </p> <p>2. The main weapon of the learner is Why? - Always ask this question. Searching for the answer will help you gain a deeper understanding of the topic. </p> <p>3. More important than knowledge: Anti-knowledge. That is, knowing what you don't know. As your knowledge increases, so does your anti-knowledge. </p> <p>4. The biggest mistake of a learner is thinking: "I don't need to write, I will remember." </p> <p>5. If you can't explain something in 5 sentences or less, you don't understand it. Those who can explain the simplest are those who understand the subject best. </p> <p>6. Example of normal learning speed: You must find your thoughts about this topic 1 year ago funny. </p> <p>7. Books, lectures, videos are a great source of knowledge. But the most important thing is that the knowledge that is not found everywhere and is very useful is spread by word of mouth.</p> <p><strong>Aziz Rahimov</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/1/1-sinf-fransuz-tili" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
