However, among these obligations, the task of <strong>ensuring that students are in the classroom</strong> is not specified.</p> <p>Therefore, it is wrong to <strong>discipline the head of the class for low attendance of students. In this case, the disciplinary punishment is disproportionate to the actions of the teacher, and according to <strong>Articles 301 and 313</strong> of the Labor Code of the new version, the teacher can apply to the <strong>District Justice Department</strong> or the <strong>State Labor Law Inspector</strong>.</strong></p> <p>Action can be taken against <strong>parents</strong> in case of students not coming to class. <strong>According to Article 47 of the Administrative Responsibility Code</strong>, if parents do not fulfill their obligations to raise and educate minor children, they may be fined one to five times the amount of the basic calculation. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qabul-ochildi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
