                Today's most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>My question is, do I have the right to expel students who do not obey the school rules?</strong><br/><strong> ✅ Answer: Students cannot be expelled for being late to classes or not in school uniform.</strong><br/><strong>To the curriculum if they do not enter, they cannot be left out of class for other work.</strong><br/><hr/> <blockquote> <p>Hello. In our school, four 10th graders come to school without uniforms, they don't even bring their school supplies, and sometimes they come late to classes. I am a history teacher and I also lead this class. Because I am a woman, some of my students do not obey me. Recently I expelled them from class, I heard from our director. My question is, do I have the right to expel students who do not obey the rules of the school? </p> </blockquote> <p> ✅<strong> Answer:</strong></p> <p>Students cannot be expelled for being late to classes or not in school uniform. </p> <p>If they are not included in the curriculum, they cannot be left out of class for other work. There is no provision in the regulatory documents about leaving a student who comes to school unattended during the lesson and expelling them from the lesson for being late, lack of school equipment or school uniform. The educational process in educational institutions should be based on the principles of "legality, democracy, non-discrimination and respect". </p> <p>❓ <strong>Then what action will be taken against the students who do not obey the internal rules of the school?</strong></p> <p>When students violate the internal rules and etiquette, their paper or electronic write a reprimand in the diary, and in the case of repeated violations of the rules, the student can be included in the school's internal control list and deal with it individually, if this does not work, transfer the student who broke the rules to another class, discuss it among the class team, invite his parents (persons who replace them) to the school, and discuss it within the public council of the "Family-Neighborhood-Educational Institution" partnership.</p> <p><strong>These rules cases of non-compliance can also be discussed in the monitoring councils of the educational institution.</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/abituriyent-va-talabalar-uchun-super-foydali-onlayn-manbalar-toplami" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
