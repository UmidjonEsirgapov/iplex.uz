                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>As we all know, Germany is one of the few countries where higher education is free for national and international students.</strong><br/><strong>However, students are required to pay a semester fee.</strong><br/><strong>Offered course: Bachelor of Arts in European Cultures and Society (more) Curriculum language: English Duration: 6 semesters (3 years) Curriculum fee: Studying in this course is free Application submission dates: Admission for international students is from December 1 to January 31, 2021.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Purpose of the post:</strong></p> <p>Through this post, we are at the <strong>Europa-Universität in Germany. We will take a look at one of the free English-language undergraduate courses at Flensburg University and the full application process. Is higher education in Germany absolutely free? As we all know, Germany is one of the few countries where higher education is free for national and international students. In addition, it is considered one of the most developed countries in the world. It is natural for any person to have the desire to study in Germany at least once. Now the question arises, "Is education in Germany really completely free?" <u><strong>The answer is "Yes and No".</strong></u> I will try to give a full explanation below for the answer.</strong></p> <p><strong>Note:</strong></p> <p>Most universities in Germany (national and government funded) do not charge students a tuition fee. But students are required to pay the semester fee. The cost of the semester fee may vary from one university to another, but in most universities the amount of this fee does not exceed 250 euros per semester. We can say that education in Germany is free because it is not a big amount and this fee is charged for administrative work done by the university for the student. But not all universities in Germany are absolutely free. As an example, we can take universities in the cities that are part of the German <strong>Baden-Wurttemberg</strong> region. These universities have started demanding tuition fees from international students for some courses from the 2017/18 academic year. That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany. But education in most universities is free, as we said above.</p> <p><strong>Education in Germany through English:</strong></p> <p>As in many developed countries, German universities offer courses taught in English. But the number of such courses for a bachelor's degree is significantly less than for a master's degree. But this does not mean that it does not exist at all. Today we will talk about the <strong>Europa-Universität Flensburg</strong>, which offers such a bachelor's course, and the procedure for sending documents for the bachelor's course it offers.</p> <p><strong>Short about Europa-Universität Flensburg:</strong></p> <p><strong>Europa-Universität Flensburg</strong> is one of the prestigious German public universities. This university is located in the district of Flensburg, which is close to Denmark. This university offers many courses for national and international students.</p> <p><img alt="See the source image" src="https://www.aaup.edu/sites/default/files/1200px-Luftaufnahme_des_Campus_Flensburg_0.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>Course offered:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Bachelor of Arts in European Cultures and Society (<strong>more</strong>)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Curriculum language:</strong></p> <ul> <li>English</li> </ul> <p><strong>Duration:</strong></p> <ul> <li>6 semesters (3 years)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Curriculum fee:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Studying in this course free of charge</li> </ul> <p><strong>Dates for submission of documents:</strong></p> <p>Admission for international students will be <strong>from December 1 to January 31, 2021 </strong>.
