                Today's most relevant message in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>By hand or on the computer.</strong><br/><strong>Record only the important words and phrases of the teacher; Use your own words to make your notes understandable; Write down new words.</strong><br/><strong>Information will be absorbed more firmly; Learn abbreviations and the use of symbols and abbreviations.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Middle and high school students know what an outline is, but do they know how to remember difficult dates, quotes, and facts?</strong></p> <p><strong>Outlining</strong> is important. The ability to write activates the parts of the brain that help to remember information for a long time. When we outline a topic, we help ourselves create a visual range through which information can be absorbed more effectively.</p> <p>By hand or on a computer. Both this method and that method have their pros and cons. While working on the computer, you can be distracted by games, the Internet or messengers. But on the other hand, if you use cloud resources, data is stored more reliably. Writing by hand is more useful, but in today's world, people write faster on computers. It doesn't matter what you prefer, even if it's a sticker album - isn't that a creative approach to synopsis? The main thing is that no matter what method you choose, it should be convenient for you.</p> <p><strong>General tips for taking notes:</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/chet-tilini-bilish-darajasini-aniqlash-boyicha-test-sinovlari-yakunlandi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <ul> <li>Note the main points of the lesson;</li> <li>Don't write everything.
