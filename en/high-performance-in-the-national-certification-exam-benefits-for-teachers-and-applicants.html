                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Preferences for applicants If the applicant has a score of 86% or higher in the national certificate exam, the maximum score will be awarded in the entrance exams for the relevant subject. If he gets a result of 60% or higher, he will be given a maximum of 11 points in the compulsory subject of the mother tongue.</strong><br/><strong>This shows that the national certificate is important for the applicants in the compulsory subject exams.</strong><br/><hr/> <h3>What benefits does the national certificate give?</h3> <p>Obtaining a national certificate creates great opportunities not only for applicants, but also for teachers. Below you can familiarize yourself with the benefits granted according to the results achieved in the national certification exams.</p> <h4>1. Benefits for teachers</h4> <p>If a teacher scores <strong>80% or higher</strong> in the national certification exam, a <strong>20% bonus</strong> will be added to their monthly salary. This is a way to encourage teachers to regularly update their knowledge, which serves to increase the level of quality education.</p> <h4>2. Benefits to applicants</h4> <p>If the applicant has <strong>86% or higher</strong> in the national certificate exam, <strong>maximum score</strong> will be given in the entrance exams in the relevant subject. For example, if mother tongue and literature is a subject of block 1, the applicant will be awarded <strong>93 points</strong>, and <strong>63 points</strong> if it is a subject of block 2. Also, a maximum of <strong>11 points</strong> is provided from the mandatory 10 tests.</p> <p>If the applicant gets a result <strong>from 60% to 85%</strong> as a result of the exam, he is given <strong>proportional points</strong> in relation to the percentage. For example, for a result of <strong>80%</strong>, the applicant is awarded <strong>80% of 93 points</strong> (ie <strong>74.4 points</strong>).</p> <h4>3. Compulsory subject concessions</h4> <p>If an applicant is preparing for a compulsory 10-point test in the subject of <strong>mother tongue</strong> and achieves <strong>60% or higher</strong> in the national certificate exam, he will be awarded a <strong>maximum of 11 points</strong> in the compulsory subject of mother tongue. This shows that the national certificate is also important for the applicants in compulsory science exams. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/bitiruvchi-talabalarni-ishga-qabul-qilishda-sinov-muddati-qollash-mumkinmi-2" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
