There was a change in only 2 directions:</p> <p>🔻 <strong>Veterinary</strong> — 60 points (last year it was 80 points); to those who want to transfer their studies; <li>to those who want to transfer their studies from non-state HEIs in our country and branches of foreign HEIs to state HEIs.</li>  <p>The proposal to equalize the passing scores when transferring studies with the passing scores of last year's entrance exams was not accepted this year either. In my opinion, they said that if this is done, it will be a "dash" and it is better to set a single score that is more general and understandable.</p> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> applications for transfer of study will be accepted online from <strong>July 15</strong>.</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/5/1100__CVBaiab7w5Dh2dHwstecSNnupxZO4Ewc.png"/> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/bepul-onlayn-kurslar-toplami" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How do you look at this news?
