                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Note: Most universities in Germany (national and government funded) do not charge students a tuition fee.</strong><br/><strong>However, students are required to pay a semester fee.</strong><br/><strong>Education through English in Germany: As in many developed countries, German universities offer courses taught in English.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Purpose of the post:</strong></p> <p>Through this post, we will take a look at one of the <strong>masters</strong> courses taught in English for free at <strong>Regensburg</strong> University in Germany and the full application process.</p> <p><strong>Is higher education in Germany </strong><strong>absolutely</strong><strong> free?</strong></p> <p>As we all know, Germany is one of the few countries where higher education is free for national and international students. In addition, it is considered one of the most developed countries in the world. It is natural for any person to have the desire to study in Germany at least once. Now the question arises, "Is education in Germany really completely free?" <u><strong>The answer is "Yes and No".</strong></u> I will try to give a full explanation below for the answer.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong></p> <p>Most universities in Germany (national and government funded) do not charge students a tuition fee. But students are required to pay the semester fee. The cost of the semester fee may vary from one university to another, but in most universities the amount of this fee does not exceed 250 euros per semester. We can say that education in Germany is free because it is not a big amount and this fee is charged for administrative work done by the university for the student. But not all universities in Germany are absolutely free. As an example, we can take universities in cities that are part of the German <strong>Baden-Wurttemberg</strong> region. These universities have started demanding tuition fees from international students for some courses from the 2017/18 academic year. That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany. But education in most universities is free, as we said above.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Education in Germany through English:</strong></p> <p>As in many developed countries, German universities offer courses taught in English. Although the number of such courses for the bachelor's degree is significantly less than for the master's level, this does not mean that there are none at all. Today we will talk about the <strong>University of Regensburg</strong> <strong> </strong>, which offers such a master's course, and the procedure for sending documents for <strong>2</strong> of the master's courses it offers.</p> <p><strong>Regensburg University in brief:</strong></p> <p>The University of Regensburg (German: Universität Regensburg) is a UNESCO World Heritage city in the middle of Bavaria. a state research university located in the century-old city of Regensburg. The university was founded on July 18, 1962 by the Bavarian Landtag as the fourth full-fledged university in Bavaria. The University of Regensburg ranks <strong>#601-650</strong> in the ranking of world universities published by the QS World University Rankings.</p> <p><img alt="See the source image" src="https://www-app.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/PKGG/master-egw/wp-content/uploads/Campus_Winter_CB_01-1.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>Proposed course:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Masters of Arts (M.A.): <ul> <li>English Linguistics (in detail)</li> <li>British Studies (in detail)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Language of curriculum:</strong></p> <ul> <li>English</li> </ul> <p><strong>Duration:</strong></p> <ul> <li>4 semester</li> </ul> <p><strong>Study program fee:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Studying in these courses is free</li> </ul> <p><strong>Dates for sending documents:</strong></p> <p>At the moment, the period for accepting documents for the winter semester of the university has not yet opened.
