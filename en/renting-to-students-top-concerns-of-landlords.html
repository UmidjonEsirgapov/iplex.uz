                Today's most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>This not only violates the contract, but also creates additional problems for the landlord.</strong><br/><strong>The originally agreed amount is not collected in full or the payments are late.</strong><br/><strong>Problems with the neighbors Students often cause inconvenience to the neighbors.</strong><br/><hr/> <h3>Why are landlords afraid to rent to students, especially young men?</h3> <p>It is not easy for students, especially young men, to find a house to rent. Experience shows that many landlords have difficulty negotiating with students, and in some cases deny them the opportunity to rent. There are several reasons for this.</p> <h4>Non-compliance with agreements</h4> <p>The most common problem for landlords is the violation of agreements by students. For example, at first 4 people agree to live together, and then 6-7 or even 10 people can go. When the owner of the house comes to check, there are many cases of deception that "this is a guest". This is not only against the contracts, but also creates additional problems for the landlord.</p> <h4>Payment problems</h4> <p>The main goal of landlords is, of course, to make a profit. However, this issue is often difficult for students. The originally agreed amount is not collected in full or payments are delayed. For example, if 4 students come to live for 300 dollars, a part of this money can be given as chalah or nasia. And when the landlord comes looking, only some will be charged $150, but you can't ask for even that, because they've at least tried to pay their share.</p> <h4>Utilities and home repairs</h4> <p>Utilities are often not paid on time, resulting in debt. Home repairs are neglected, and it's almost natural for repairs to become disreputable. This leads to big costs for the owner of the house.</p> <h4>Issue of cleanliness</h4> <p>In recent years, not only boys, but also girls are neglecting their hair. In many cases, the houses are dirty and messy: shoes and socks are lying around, a week's worth of garbage has accumulated, and the sinks are overflowing. The cleanliness in the house is not taken care of and this situation can upset the owner of the house.</p> <h4>Problems with the neighbors</h4> <p>Students often cause inconvenience to the neighbors. This leads to complaints from neighbors and even police intervention. Such problems can be a big headache for the landlord and the neighbors.</p> <p>Students should be careful when renting, feel responsible and fully comply with the agreements with the landlord. This not only improves the relationship with the landlord, but also increases the chances of finding another house in the future. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/3-yil-tahsil-olinadigan-bakalavriat-yonalishlari" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
