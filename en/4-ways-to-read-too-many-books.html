                The most relevant news in education today is:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>If so, you are wrong.</strong><br/><strong>Use every free moment Author Stephen King credits his success as an author to reading books, and he advises you to read books too.</strong><br/><strong>So if you want to read more books if you are, make it your goal, but don't tell others about it.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>You probably know that reading is the key to success, a stress reliever, and a great memory booster. However, you will never find time to read a book. We hope that the following tips will help you in this regard.</p> <p><img class="border ls-is-cached lazyloaded" data-action="zoom" data-src="/cache/2017/06/20-prichin-chitat-knigi-500x334.jpg" src="https://daryo.uz/cache/2017/06/20-prichin-chitat-knigi-500x334.jpg"/></p> <p>Photo: Flickr</p> <h3>If you don't like the book, don't read it</h3> <p>Don't you want to be seen as a person who bows down in the face of difficulties? So do you force yourself to read a book you don't like? If so, you are wrong. If you don't like a book, don't read it and stop blaming yourself for it.</p> <h3>Use every free moment</h3> <p>Writer Stephen King credits his success as an author to reading books, and he advises you to read books too. Especially if you want to be a writer. He himself does not leave the house without a book and reads everywhere.</p> <p>You will spend a lot of free minutes reading during the day. For example, when you're waiting in line or in traffic.</p> <h3>Don't talk about your plans</h3> <p>Researchers find that talking about big goals in advance rarely leads to success. So if you want to read more books, make it a goal, but don't tell others about it.</p> <h3>Read paper books</h3> <p>Reading paper books will help you avoid distractions and waste your willpower. When reading books on electronic devices, we often access the Internet and have to stop reading.</p> <p></p> <p>It is also nice to hold paper books in our hands. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oqishni-kochirish-uchun-arizaga-qanday-sabab-yozish-kerak" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz website.
