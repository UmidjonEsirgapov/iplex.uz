                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The Regulation "On the procedure for attracting teachers-pedagogues from other regions to teach in schools with a low level of education" does not contain a provision on the conclusion of a fixed-term employment contract with pedagogues. if not, the employment contract is considered to be concluded for an indefinite period.</strong><br/><strong>It is not possible to conclude a fixed-term employment contract with teachers-pedagogues recruited from other regions to teach in schools with a low level of education.</strong><br/><hr/> <h3>What will happen if the contract period of a teacher working in a "red" school expires?</h3> <h4>Question</h4> <p>In September 2021, I I got a job at a red school in the neighboring district. The contract was concluded for 3 years. The contract expires in September 2024. Now I want to continue working in this school. Does the head of the school have the right to cancel the contract even if I do not write a resignation letter? Can I continue the work even if the contract period has expired?</p> <h4>Answer</h4> <p>According to <strong>Decision PQ-4940-50n of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan dated January 11, 2021</strong> and <strong>Decision No. 646 of the Cabinet of Ministers dated October 15, 2021</strong>, the level of education is not high. The procedure for recruiting teachers-pedagogues from other regions to teach in schools has been established. According to it, pedagogues with a higher education and a first or higher qualification category, with at least one year of teaching experience, will be paid a 50 to 100 percent bonus if they are recruited from other regions to schools with low educational quality.</p> <p>According to the current regulations, based on the established procedure teachers-pedagogues are hired for vacant positions in accordance with the procedure established by law from the first day of the new academic year. The Regulation of "<strong>On the procedure for attracting teachers-pedagogues from other regions to teach in schools with a low level of education</strong>" does not contain a provision on the conclusion of a fixed-term employment contract with pedagogues. Even if such a rule existed, it would be contrary to the Labor Code. Article 111 of the Labor Code lists the grounds for concluding a fixed-term employment contract. Also, <strong>Articles 112, 113</strong> list the cases in which a fixed-term employment contract can and must be concluded. If the fixed-term employment contract does not comply with the requirements established in Articles 112, 113, the employment contract is considered to be concluded for an indefinite period. It is not possible to conclude a fixed-term employment contract with teachers-pedagogues recruited from other regions to teach in schools with a low level of education.</p> <h4>Conclusion</h4> <p>Even if the employment contract with a pedagogue recruited from another region to "<strong>Kyzil</strong>" school has expired, the pedagogue can continue working in this school. Because there are insufficient grounds for concluding a fixed-term employment contract.</p> <p>Attention: If a teacher has worked in a school of the "red" category for two academic years, the bonuses paid for working in this school will be suspended. Because according to <strong>Chapter 5, Clause 22</strong> of the Regulation "On the procedure for attracting teachers-pedagogues from other regions to teach in schools with a low level of education, if the school where the teachers-pedagogues are working is not removed from the list of schools with a low level of education during two academic years, the teachers-pedagogues will be paid for being recruited from other regions" payment of special allowances will be suspended. Special allowances are paid for the academic year following the year of deregistration if the school attended by pedagogues is removed from the list of schools with a low level of education. That is, regardless of the situation, special allowances are paid only during two academic years. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ozbekiston-mukofot-jamgarmasi-800-million-som-bolgan-tourism-the-path-to-innovation-tanlovi-elon-qilindi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p>
