                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>The amount of the super-contract for those who have not reached 4 points The prices of the super-contract are determined by how many points you have scored less than the passing score: those who have not reached 1 point - 1.5 times the basic contract.</strong><br/><strong>In the first year, only the super-contract is paid.</strong><br/><strong>Super-contract opportunities Studying in any five fields Last year, it was possible to choose one of five fields and study on the basis of a super-contract.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Complete information about the super-contract (year 2025)</h2> <p>Many applicants who did not get admission have questions about the <strong>super-contract</strong>.

More information will be provided upon confirmation. You can see the prices for 2024 through this link.</p> <h2>Super-contract amount for under 4 points</h2> <p>Super-contract prices are determined depending on how many points you scored below the passing score:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Under 1 point</strong> is <strong>1.5 times</strong> of the base contract. <em>(For example, if the contract is 10 million soums, the super-contract will be 15 million soums)</em>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>1.01 - up to 2 points</strong> - <strong>2 times</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>2.01 - up to 3 points</strong> - <strong>2.5 times</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Up to 3.01 - 4 points</strong> - <strong>3 times</strong>.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Are ordinary contract and super-contract paid together?</h2> <p>No. In the first year, only the super-contract is paid. Starting from the second year, a regular contract will be paid.</p> <h2>How to apply</h2> <ul> <li> <p><strong>When will it start?</strong> — In September, when studies start (last year it started on September 2).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Where will it be submitted?</strong> — Only online. There is no need to go to the ATM, wait in line, or beg.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Whoever submits first gets in?</strong> - No. Applicants are ranked according to their scores, priority is given to those with higher scores.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Is it possible to super-contract to another direction?</h2> <p>This year's order is not yet known. Last year, super-contracting was allowed only in <strong>the first chosen field</strong>.</p> <h2>Super-contract options</h2> <h3>Study in any five fields</h3> <p>Last year, it was possible to choose one of five fields and study on the basis of a super-contract. This year's rules have not yet been approved.</p> <h3>Obtaining education loans</h3> <p>State education loans are not issued for super-contracts. But banks can offer commercial loans. After the 2nd year, it is possible to get an education loan.</p> <h3>Possibility to transfer to a grant</h3> <p>Those studying in the super-contract also have the right to transfer to a grant if they learn well after the 1st year.</p> <h3>Payment in installments</h3> <p>The amount of the super-contract can be paid in 4 parts.</p> <h2>Opportunity for those who scored less than 56.7 points</h2> <p>The answer is here.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Super-contract is an additional opportunity for applicants who did not get admission.
