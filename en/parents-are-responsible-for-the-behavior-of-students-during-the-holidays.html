                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Responsibility for the behavior of students outside the educational institution during the school holidays is placed directly on the parents.</strong><br/><strong>On June 27, 2023, according to order No. 190 of the Minister of Preschool and School Education, from the territory of the educational institution outside, including during the holidays, parents are responsible for the behavior of students according to the law.</strong><br/><strong>In this order, class leaders or deputy principals of the school are not held responsible.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Responsibility for the behavior of students outside the educational institution during the school holidays is directly assigned to the parents. According to Order No. 190 of the Minister of Preschool and School Education dated June 27, 2023, parents are legally responsible for the behavior of students outside the territory of the educational institution, including on vacation. In this order, class leaders or deputy school principals are not held responsible.</p> <p>Also, Article 73 of the "Family Code" of the Republic of Uzbekistan clearly defines the responsibility of parents to raise their children. According to these legal grounds, parents should pay special attention to their children's health, spiritual and moral development. These standards provide for parents to actively communicate with their children during the holidays and take full responsibility for their actions. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/2024-yil-iii-choragida-xorijiy-taʼlim-hujjatlarini-tan-olish-boyicha-test-sinovlari-muddatlari" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz website.
