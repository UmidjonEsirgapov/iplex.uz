Even if the student is admitted to the contract, if he is considered worthy of the President's grant, he will study on the basis of the grant! But even if the student fails to complete any subject with an "excellent" grade, he will receive a regular scholarship instead of a presidential grant scholarship in the next semester. If he closes the next semester with an "excellent" grade, the student will continue to receive the grant scholarship. The amount of this scholarship is the same as that of the President's scholarship.</p> <p>Students who have received a grant scholarship continuously until graduation will be admitted to the master's degree in their field without an exam based on the grant. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/farmatsiya-yonalishi-uchun-79-nafar-talabgorlarning-birortasi-oqishini-kochira-olmagan" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
