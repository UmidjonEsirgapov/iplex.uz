                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Why should you read a lot of books?</strong><br/><strong>By spending 20-50% of this time reading books, you can increase your knowledge and achieve success in life.</strong><br/><strong>If you read 200 words per minute, that is 25,000 minutes or 417 hours.</strong><br/><hr/> <h3>Why should you read a lot of books?</h3> <p>The most successful people in the world always emphasize the importance of reading. They read books every day or every week and expand their knowledge. Numerous studies and experiments confirm that reading books can lead to success in life and work.</p> <h4>What books do successful people read?</h4> <ul> <li><strong>Bill Gates</strong>, the founder of Microsoft, reads <strong>50 books</strong> a year. This means reading 1 book a week.</li> <li>Engineer, writer and inventor <strong>Elon Musk</strong> claims that he reads a lot of books. When he was young, he read several hours a day.</li> <li><strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong>, founder of Facebook, spends time reading one book every <strong>2 weeks</strong>. This means 24 books a year.</li> <li>The world's largest investor <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> spends <strong>80% of his free time reading</strong>. Before starting his business, he read <strong>500 pages</strong> of books a day.</li> </ul> <p>It is not difficult to see the connection between the success of these people, their passion for learning and the number of books they mastered. They consume 20-50 times more information than an ordinary person, so you should not be surprised at their intelligence.</p> <h4>The excuse of not having time to read a book</h4> <p>Many people think that "I don't have time to read a book". But research shows that the modern person spends <strong>608 hours</strong> on social media and <strong>1642 hours</strong> on YouTube, movies and TV a year. For a total of <strong>2250 hours</strong>, more time is spent on mostly useless material. By spending 20-50% of this time reading books, you can increase your knowledge and achieve success in life.</p> <h4>Is it possible to read 100 books?</h4> <p>Reading 100 books a year is practically possible. If the average book is <strong>50,000 words</strong>, you will need to read a total of <strong>5 million words</strong>. If you read 200 words per minute, that's <strong>25,000 minutes</strong> or <strong>417 hours</strong>. Therefore, it is not impossible to devote 417 hours to reading books during the year.</p> <h4>Why should you read books?</h4> <p>Reading books will help you to excel in any field. Successful people attribute their success to reading. Books not only give you knowledge, but also expand your worldview and expand your thinking. It is important to choose a book carefully and apply it in practice. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/chet-tili-imtihoni-qayerda-otkaziladi-toliq-royxat" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
