                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>For example, currently a monthly scholarship is 517 thousand 880 soums.</strong><br/><strong>So if a student wants to receive a scholarship every month, he will have to pay a contract of 12 million 627 thousand 170 soums.</strong><br/><strong>In addition to education it is possible to consider the option of receiving a contract with a scholarship even after receiving a loan. The table of contracts shows the basic, i.e. amounts without stipend. That is, the students who have paid this amount of the contract will not be given a scholarship. <p><strong>What should those on the contract also do to get a scholarship?</strong></p> <p>For this, the <strong>12-month scholarship money</strong> should be added to the contract and paid.</p> <p>For example, currently one month scholarship is 517 thousand 880 soums. If we multiply this by 12 months, it will be 6 million 214 thousand 560 soums. Then, if the student wants to receive a scholarship every month, he will have to pay a contract of 12 million 627 thousand 170 soums.</p> <p>Then he will get back the money he paid in monthly installments in the form of a scholarship.</p> <p>This is not a very beneficial offer in a normal situation, but in some cases, if it is possible, it is better to pay in the form of a scholarship. In addition, if those who pay from the salary in their office convert it to a scholarship, they will get an additional benefit of 745,000 soums in 1 year from the tax deduction. Especially for girls, it will be more useful, because they will be given an interest-free loan. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/bill-geytsdan-yoshlar-uchun-hayotni-ozgartiruvchi-11-maslahat" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.</strong>
