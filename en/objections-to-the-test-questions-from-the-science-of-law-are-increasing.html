                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Objections to tests in legal science continue. The Agency for the Evaluation of Knowledge has responded for the second time. BMB gave an official response to this.</strong><br/><strong>Even after that, objections regarding test questions on social networks do not stop.</strong><br/><hr/> <h3><strong>Objections regarding tests in jurisprudence do not stop</strong></h3> <p>Evaluation of knowledge agency reacted for the second time. Earlier, there were reports that in the entrance tests of higher education institutions, questions were made from information not included in the textbook, in particular, laws and codes, and BMB gave an official response to this. In particular, <strong>Rasul Kusherbayev</strong> also reacted to this and wrote that the agency should <strong>be sued</strong>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>According to the agency</strong>, legal sciences are a fast-changing social science, the information in the textbook becomes outdated with the updating of legal documents, and every citizen regularly familiarizes himself with the current legal documents.</p> <p>It is necessary to take into account the new version of legal documents if done, the subjects in the curriculum will remain unchanged. Taking into account the above, the test materials for legal sciences were formed on the basis of current legal documents, and the content of the test tasks was adapted to the curriculum of legal sciences.</p> <p>The list of recommended textbooks and educational literature for the applicants to prepare for the entrance tests for the undergraduate education of higher educational institutions is also posted on the agency's website. , information was also published on how test tasks in jurisprudence are formed taking into account the amendments and additions made to normative legal documents, when changes are made to legal documents in the prescribed manner, the original source of the law (national database of legislative information of the Republic of Uzbekistan - lex.uz site) is referred to. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/jizzax-davlat-pedagogika-universiteti" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> </blockquote> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
