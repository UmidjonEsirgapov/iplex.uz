                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>In higher education, the new academic year will begin remotely.</strong><br/><strong>From September, students of the upper level (from the second level) will start studying online.</strong><br/><strong>Currently, starting from September, students of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th years will be studying online. we will start, if the pandemic eases a little after we receive the 1st courses in October, then maybe we will return to the traditional system," said Oktam Umurzakov.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>The new academic year in higher education will begin remotely. Traditional education can begin after October.</strong></p> <p>From September, students of the upper level (from the second level) will study online Oktam Umurzakov, chairman of the Republican Higher Education Council, reported this. Since March, we have been conducting classes online, but whether we like it or not, the online system cannot replace the traditional, face-to-face class system. For the time being, we will start studying online for 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students from September, and if the pandemic eases a little after we have accepted the 1st year students in October, then maybe we will return to the traditional system," said Oktam Umurzokov.</p> <p>We remind you that this year the entrance exams to the OTM will be held in stadiums in two shifts. The exams are planned to last 12-14 days. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/abituriyentlar-yodlab-oling-majburiy-blokda-100-tushadi-yil-nomlari" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
