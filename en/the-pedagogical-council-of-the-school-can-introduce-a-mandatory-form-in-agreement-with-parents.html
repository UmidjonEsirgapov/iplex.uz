                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The school pedagogical council can introduce a mandatory uniform in agreement with parents - since the minister has not set a specific deadline for the introduction of a uniform school uniform, we previously reported that the school uniform will not be mandatory from the new academic year.</strong><br/><strong>We remind you that May 19, 2022 271 of the government, it was decided that the school uniform will be mandatory from the 2022-2023 school year, not from the 2024-2025 school year.</strong><br/><strong>However, as the introduction of the school uniform caused various objections from parents and the general public, the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers dated October 3, 2022 With the decision No. 558, the requirement to introduce a uniform school uniform of an approved form for students in public general secondary educational institutions was officially canceled starting from the 2022/2023 academic year. We previously reported that the school uniform will not be compulsory from the academic year. However, the Minister of Preschool and School Education and the Deputy Minister announced at a press conference that each school can introduce a mandatory school uniform. The Pedagogical Council of the school may introduce mandatory uniforms in agreement with parents. Also, the press secretary of the Ministry stated that in accordance with **"Improved Model Etiquette Rules of General Secondary Education Institutions"** approved by the Ministry of Preschool and School Education, each general education school has adopted its own <strong>Internal Regulations</strong> in this regard. According to these regulations, the order of schoolchildren to arrive in school uniform is determined. This does not mean that school uniforms will not be introduced. <p>We remind you that on May 19, 2022, by the government's decision No. 271, it was decided that school uniforms will be mandatory not from the 2024-2025 academic year, but from the 2022-2023 academic year. However, due to the fact that the introduction of school uniforms caused various objections by parents and the general public, the requirement to introduce a uniform school uniform in the approved form for students in public general secondary education institutions was officially canceled by <strong>Decision No. 558 of October 3, 2022</strong> from the 2022/2023 school year.</p> <p> this does not mean that the uniform school uniform has been completely abolished. Now the uniform school uniform will be introduced <strong>step by step</strong>. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ishlayotgan-yoshlar-uchun-part-time-talim-imkoniyatlari" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
