                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Teachers also play a very important role in the process of applying to foreign universities.</strong><br/><strong>As you know, there is no higher education institution in this field in Uzbekistan.</strong><br/><strong>That is why I applied there for astronomy.</strong><br/><hr/> Farangiz Kholmatova lives in Okhchi village, Fergana region, Uzbekistan. The girl, who is currently studying in the 11th grade of the 17th school, was accepted to 4 universities in the USA before the deadline and won a grant of about 300 thousand dollars. In an interview with Kun.uz, ​​he talked about how he achieved this result. <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/IfrX1d8RkwqK8zk0cJVDLy6uCRoqsrJE.jpg"/></p> <p>Our hero said that he applied to more than 30 international universities at the beginning of January. So far, 4 of them have received letters of acceptance. The graduate girl was recommended to be a student at universities in the USA such as The University of Ozarks (total grant: $80,000), Seton Hall University (total grant: $104,500), Hofstra University (total grant: $112,000) and University of Delaware. after giving it, I started to learn many things on the Internet"</p> <p>We have one son and two daughters in the family. The eldest is my brother, then my sister, who is married, and then me. My brother also has a married child. In total, 6 people live in the house: me, my brother, my daughter-in-law, my niece and my parents. I am the youngest child, my parents are retired.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/acZmugYD_l4dwP3KMvxQRfKJQ4Vlrjc_.jpg"/></p> <p>The French language is taught in our school because it is right for our school year. We have been studying French since the 5th grade. I started learning English from scratch in the 8th grade, I studied at the educational center for 6 months. After that, when I entered the 9th grade, the quarantine began, so my classes stopped. When I was in the 10th grade, a presidential school was to be opened in Ferghana, and I wanted to enter here because presidential schools are a place that gives a great incentive to enter foreign universities. I did "self study" and prepared. At that time, the quarantine continued. When my parents bought me a phone so I could study online, I started to learn a lot of things on the Internet. In order to pass the presidential school exam, I studied mathematics on You Tube (Sardorkhan Urfonkhanov has lessons from the white set on You Tube). Then I took the entrance exams, passed the first stage, but was a little short of points in the second stage.</p> <p>When I failed to enter the presidential school, I submitted my documents to 5 lyceums in Tashkent, I entered all of them, and I chose the academic lyceum at the Tashkent State University of Economics. I went and studied for a while, but due to financial reasons, I had to return to Fergana, then I continued studying at my 17th school.</p> <p>After I returned to Fergana, my teachers supported me well. When I didn't have a personal computer, our teachers gave me their computer and spared their time. Teachers play a very important role in the process of applying to foreign universities. You will need to upload letters of recommendation on their behalf. Even then, no one said no, I was able to easily send a letter of recommendation on behalf of my teachers who know me well. They helped me a lot in this regard.</p> <p><strong>"It was difficult to convince my parents because it is not easy to go to Kazakhstan and take the exam." We don't have experts on this, and the pandemic started at that time. You can't find a teacher in the whole of Kok who teaches SAT, not to mention where I live. I didn't have enough resources to study and prepare, so I had to prepare myself for IELs and SATs by searching on You tube and Google. I also tried to search for sources on the Internet, contacted students studying abroad and got information from them. After that, I took the IELs exam, I didn't have time to prepare well, so I got 6.5.</strong></p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/cGQOPwwbyR_s22ugbJFh4-qMfU_72rA1.jpg"/></p> <p>This result affected me worse, then I started preparing hard for SAT. In Uzbekistan, there were 2 educational centers where you can take the SAT exam, now there are 4. After they were full, they could only go to Kazakhstan and hand them over. In this direction, there is a teacher named Hasankhoja Muhammad Sadiq, a specialist, and this person brings the examinees to Kazakhstan every time. I saw such an ad while watching this person's Telegram channel, and then immediately sent a request to join the list. We made the payment and they arranged all travel, transportation, meals.</p> <p>It was difficult to convince my parents to go to Kazakhstan and take the SAT exam. Even after I registered, I didn't tell my family that I was going to a neighboring country, they thought I was going to Tashkent. Then I slowly explained the situation, and my parents escorted me until I reached the teacher. It was a good result. I think I got the highest score on the SAT because math was taught well in school and because I watched online classes. In fact, I was also good at English, but I think that my knowledge of mathematics helped me a lot. As the deadlines for the exam and submission of documents approached, people began to prepare harder, and I studied without sleeping at night. I went to bed at 8:10 in the evening, got up at 2 in the morning and studied until dawn. Because after 2 pm I can't sleep, I wake up automatically, brainstorming starts in my head. After the morning prayer, I continue my studies until noon. I also divide my lessons into English and mathematics, and I study accordingly. After that, I spend my time on housework. Since we live in a rural area, it is difficult to spend a lot of time studying.</p> <p>I had to spend more time studying during my vacations, and my friends would invite me to go for a walk for fun. These things should happen, but I've mostly had to turn down offers. At such a time, I had to limit myself. I would even say to those who came to my house and asked: "Send me away." I had to "disappear" in the village in order to enter a foreign higher education institution.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/dyffYlY1nkOMYmUa5aiNF7oMlj7uUGTs.jpg"/></p> <p>Preparations for entering foreign universities should be started earlier. Let's say from 7-8 grades. Because in this, apart from IELs and SAT certificates, the applicant's grades, achievements, participation in competitions, his activity, membership in international clubs are also important. I thought that I would enter Uzbekistan's state university of world languages ​​or world economy and diplomacy. I studied with this imagination until the 9th grade. From these classes, I became interested in astronomy. As you know, there is no higher education institution in this direction in Uzbekistan. Then I searched on the Internet where there are universities in astronomy and this field. Then I saw a video on YouTube about Harvard University, taken inside the academic building. I began to be interested in studying at universities in the United States. I'm going to the Olympiads in geography, I studied America from a geographical point of view. I got to know the universities. It seemed to me that studying in America was somehow more convenient. That's why I applied there for astronomy. In addition to these universities, I submitted the "regular decision deadline" to the TOP universities (this is the deadline for submitting applications to foreign universities on January 1 and finding out whether they have been accepted or not at the end of March or the beginning of April), and I am waiting for answers from 30 more universities, including HEIs of other countries. After receiving all the answers, I will get a visa and go to study, depending on the position of the university and the grant given. - they said, but then when they heard that these 4 universities accepted me and saw that people believed in me, they said, "Okay, my daughter, go ahead and make your move, we will give you the permission after you make the money move from here and enter the university of your choice." If I get into a good university and justify their trust, they will definitely send me.</p> <p>I have not yet decided which profession I will pursue in the field of astronomy, because I intend to study computer technology after I go abroad. But I have a definite goal, this is to return to Uzbekistan and build observatories for the development of astronomy and science and research.
