What are the benefits and advantages of this system? How does this work? With these and other questions, the YUZ publication turned to TDYUU vice-rector for academic affairs - director of the academic lyceum under TDYUU, doctor of law, professor Islambek Rustambekov. was organized on the basis of a credit system. The credit-module system of education is based on the openness and transparency of the educational process, including the transparency of teaching and evaluation. Also, it is a student-oriented education and independent learning, which allows for the collection and transfer of credits, thereby providing an opportunity to study at various educational institutions. In this system, a student can determine his independent educational direction, depending on which field he wants to become a specialist in the future, and continue part of his studies in foreign higher education institutions.</p> <p><strong>— What work has been done at the university regarding the implementation of the system?</strong></p> <p>— Based on the requirements of the European credit system, our university has 4 educational areas in the bachelor's degree and 8 in the master's degree this academic year. qualification requirements, study plans and subject programs (syllabi) were completely redeveloped and approved. In the development of these documents, the experience of advanced foreign higher education institutions, international standards and the requirements of today's employers were studied. Also, non-specialist subjects were reduced from 22 percent to 10-12 percent in the curricula. The block of subjects was divided into compulsory subjects and optional subjects. Optional additional credits that can be absorbed by students were also reflected in the curriculum.</p> <p><strong>— What changes have taken place in the initiation and conduct of educational processes in the new system?</strong></p> <p>— In the 2020/2021 academic year, in the context of the pandemic, classes began remotely, but an introductory week was held for all students. As part of the introductory week, all students were explained the essence of the credit-module system of education, how the university educational process is organized, how to use the distance learning platform, the procedure for submitting control work, as well as information on scientific activities, spiritual and educational work in a remote form. They learned to use the electronic platform and formed remote groups with their teachers.</p> <p>The educational process was organized using the university's distance learning platform (http://distant.tsul.uz), as well as other educational platforms, social networks and communication tools based on the accessibility and comfort level of the participants of the educational process. Through the "Zoom" software tool, seminar sessions were held in the form of organizing chats and forums, assigning tasks to students and discussing them, and control of students' attendance and learning was carried out on the basis of the distance learning platform. For this purpose, conditions have been created for students to come and study remotely at legal technical schools, justice departments, and public service centers located in the regions. How will they be distributed?</p> <p>— In the current academic year, one elective subject is defined for each semester. The student chooses a subject from the specified part of the curriculum (6 to 10 subjects are indicated). If at least 30 students choose one subject, that subject will be taught. Faculty deans provide guidance and explanations to students regarding the choice of subjects. It is planned to increase the ratio of elective subjects after our students fully understand the process.</p> <p><strong>- What is the difference between credit and grade?</strong></p> <p>- These two concepts are not the same, but they are interrelated. A credit is an indication of a student's mastery of a particular subject, which is directly linked to the hours allocated to that subject. For example, according to the curriculum, 10 credits are allocated to the criminal law module. The student will have the same 10 credits regardless of the positive learning rate of the subject, i.e. 56, 71 or 90 points.</p> <p>According to the curriculum, the student is required to acquire 60 credits in each academic year of the bachelor's level, a total of 240 credits in 4 years. The master's degree lasts 1 year, and a total of 90 credits must be collected.</p> <p><strong>— What will be the procedure for transferring students from one course to another?</strong></p> <p>— Based on the system requirements, students must accumulate 40, 100, and 140 credits and above in order to be transferred to the second, third, and fourth courses.</p> <p>Students must transfer from one course to another. who collected the credits allowed, but did not manage to collect all the credits that should be collected for the academic year, in the next academic year, they learn the same module independently or together with the lower courses. For this, it is necessary to make the payment allocated for this particular module.</p> <p><strong>- Is a student who could not master a certain subject in the credit system, that is, unable to collect credits, excluded from studies?</strong></p> <p>- According to the results of the end of each semester and academic year, the student must master the specified amount of credits. But if the student has not mastered the credits for certain reasons, his transfer to the next stage or re-reading this stage will depend on the amount of accumulated credits. In this case, the student will not be expelled from the ranks of students and will only be required to relearn the subjects for which he owes. In the credit system, such re-learning requires making appropriate payments based on the amount of relevant credits.</p> <p>In turn, even if the student remains in the course, he only re-learns the subjects that he failed to master and did not receive credit, he does not re-learn other subjects that he passed successfully and accumulated credits.</p> <p><strong>- How are the control exams submitted and evaluated?</strong></p> <p>— The university has a separate evaluation system, in which students are required to pass intermediate and final tests for each subject and have the opportunity to be evaluated with a maximum of 100 points. The evaluation process is also completely transparent, in which the control works are submitted and evaluated through the "Electronic Student Rating System (SRS - Students Report System)". In the departments, these works are distributed among professors and teachers, checked and evaluated in the system itself, and a review is written on the assigned evaluation. That is, it will be shown why it was evaluated in this way and what shortcomings the student made. The grade of the checked work and the review written on the work can be seen in the student's personal office.</p> <p>The student can file a one-time appeal against the grades given for the intermediate and final control works. In this case, the appeal will be reviewed by the commission and the evaluation may be changed based on the commission's conclusion.</p> <p><strong>- What work is currently being done or planned to improve the effectiveness of the educational process?</strong></p> <p>- We have many plans to improve the activity of our university, including the quality and efficiency of the educational process, and they will be implemented step by step.</p> <p>One of our main plans is education and management. is to fully digitize the process. Currently, a number of electronic systems for the educational process have been created and introduced. Students have the opportunity to apply electronically on any issue, the electronic system of graduation qualification works and master's dissertations and the selection of scientific supervisors has been introduced, the mechanism of electronic receipt of payment contracts and monitoring of payment arrears has been launched. All conditions have been created for students, opportunities to use an electronic library and international database have been created, practice clubs have been established, practicing specialists and foreign professors are widely involved in the educational process. I think that by implementing them, we will be able to train internationally competitive highly qualified personnel.</p> <p><strong>Javlonbek VAFOYEV talked</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kelajak-liderlari-dasturi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
