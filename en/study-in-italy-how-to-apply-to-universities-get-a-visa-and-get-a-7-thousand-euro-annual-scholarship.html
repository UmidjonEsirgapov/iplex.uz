However, many still find it difficult or hesitant to apply to foreign universities. Because the contract sums of some foreign universities are very high, and in some others education is absolutely free.</p> <p>"Spot" continues the "Education Abroad" page. This time he interviewed Abrorjon Yormatov, who is studying in Italy.</p> <p>He is 24 years old. He graduated from Tashkent State Law University in 2021. He is currently a master's student at the Faculty of European Studies at Sapienza University in Italy.</p> <p></p> <p>Abrorjon tells the story of how he went to Italy, how he was accepted to the university and his student life.</p> <h3>Why Italy</h3> <p>Italy has not only beautiful nature, but also its long history. The recognition of the city of Rome as an eternal city is a clear example of this.</p> <p>Due to my interest in history and culture, I visited historical places in Italy in my spare time and studied the lifestyle, customs and culture of Italians.</p> <blockquote> <p>If I stop academically, there are 47 universities in Italy, and Sapienza University, which I chose, is the third among them. </p> </blockquote> <p>In a way, this also indicates the prestige of this university.</p> <p>In addition, Sapienza University is included in the world's prestigious rankings, including the Top-500, so I think that in the future it can be a springboard to find a job in my field, and to continue my academic career in other prestigious universities of the world.</p> <h3>University admission process</h3> <p>The country's education system, like Uzbekistan, consists of four levels, namely pre-school education, primary, secondary and higher education.</p> <p></p> <p>In turn, higher education includes three levels: bachelor's, master's and doctorate. A bachelor's degree can last from three to six years. It varies by sector.</p> <blockquote> <p>In Italy, foreign students can receive up to 7,000 euros in scholarships depending on the region and the country's "poverty category". Uzbekistan is one of these countries.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is a platform universityly.it that provides information about educational programs in the country.</p> <p>It has an extensive search system, which includes information about the admission quota, directions, program duration, language of instruction, grant programs and a link to the official website of all universities in the country. required. It is not important to know Italian, but it is good to learn it in order to communicate with people in everyday life. Admission requirements are different for each university.</p> <p>In addition, since the school system in Uzbekistan is 11 years old, those who want to study a bachelor's degree in Italy cannot start studying immediately after graduation. Because the school education system of the country is 12 years, the candidates must first pass the "Foundation" course.</p> <blockquote> <p>If the candidate plans to enter any university, it is better to take the "Foundation" course at this university. Because some universities may not accept the preparation certificate of another university.</p> </blockquote> <p>The documents required for applying for bachelor's and master's degrees are almost the same, mainly the following documents should be sent:</p> <ul> <li>application;</li> <li>copy of passport;</li> <li>2 photos;</li> <li>school certificate for bachelor's degree, and notarized translation of bachelor's degree for master's degree (apostille) with);</li> <li>certificate of completion of a preparatory program for a bachelor's degree in Italy;</li> <li>language certificate (such as IELTS,TOEFL);</li> <li>CV;</li> <li>motivation letter;</li> <li>recommendation, etc.</li> </ul> <p><img class="fr-fic fr-dii lazy" data-loaded="true" data-src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/02/q1jdVM16775812415926_b.jpg" src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/02/q1jdVM16775812415926_b.jpg"/></p> <p>Photo: from personal archive of Abrorjon Yormatov</p> <p>An important condition for admission to the master's program is that the completed bachelor's degree corresponds to the chosen field of the master's program. Some universities may also require additional exams for this degree.</p> <h3>Scholarships</h3> <p>Different scholarships are awarded to students in Italy and the requirements may vary by region of the country.</p> <p></p> <p>The amount of scholarships varies each year. In particular, the amount of the scholarship allocated at the university where I am studying was 7000 euros, and 25% of the total scholarship will be paid by February for the first-year students, and the remaining part will be paid at the end of the summer months.</p> <blockquote> <p>For those studying in the second year, half of the scholarship, i.e. 50%, will be paid by December, and the remaining part will be paid by the end of the summer.</p> </blockquote> <p>The scholarship is one allocated per year, and those with more than two years of education report their financial status annually. That is, in this case, they must provide information about the absence of income, real estate, and property in their name.</p> <p>Anyone who is a student of a state university located in any region can submit documents to the scholarship program. Every year, documents for the scholarship can be submitted electronically until the specified time in the summer months of June-July.</p> <p>If the student is admitted to the first stage, he must submit the electronic documents with proper approval upon arrival in Italy.</p> <h3>Visa process</h3> <p>Before submitting an application for a visa to Italy, it is necessary to receive an acceptance letter. After that, in order to enter the interview at the embassy, it is necessary to make a reservation in advance, that is, to register through its website.</p> <p>After that, it will be possible to enter the interview for a visa on the specified date.</p> <p>Required documents for the embassy:</p> <ul> <li>identity document;</li> <li>documents of education;</li> <li>financial documents confirming the status;</li> <li>insurance.</li> <li>information about air ticket reservation;</li> <li>1 photo;</li> <li>information about where to stay after going to Italy</li> <li>acceptance letter from the university;</li> <li>English language certificate;</li> <li>information from the workplace.</li> </ul> <p>Documents in Uzbek and Russian languages in English or must be translated into Italian.</p> <p></p> <p>Also, the embassy may ask for additional documents, which must be submitted with the original copy of information about the parent's place of work and income. If the parents have a private business, copies of the relevant documents will be requested.</p> <blockquote> <p>These documents will be attached to the interview. During the interview, the applicant will be asked questions about the purpose of going to Italy and which university he is going to.</p> </blockquote> <p>In general, a visa will be issued within 10-12 days, depending on the readiness of the documents.</p> <p>In addition, the "Declaration of value" (DOV), i.e., a document equating to education in Uzbekistan, must be made, and it will also be done through the embassy.</p> <p><img class="fr-fic fr-dii lazy" data-loaded="true" data-src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/02/Y7qtxw16775813523040_b.jpg" src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/02/Y7qtxw16775813523040_b.jpg"/></p> <p>Photo: Abrorjon From Yormatov's personal archive</p> <h3>Study and exams</h3> <p>The study process depends on the student, that is, subjects are selected based on interest and a "study plan" is drawn up.</p> <blockquote> <p>However, the "study plan" should be drawn up 2 years in advance for a master's degree, and 3 years for a bachelor's degree. If the student wants to change it in the next academic year, he can change it after the end of the current academic year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Currently, due to the earthquake observed in Turkey, a certain category of students has been given the opportunity to attend classes online.</p> <p>Exams in universities are usually held face-to-face. Due to the above situation, I did not know whether the online process will be applied to the exams, but it may be. The second semester runs from February to May, and after May the exams begin.</p> <p>I should also mention the scholarship aspect of the exams. That is, to justify the scholarship of the current academic year, it is necessary to collect at least 20 credits out of a total of 60. When applying for a scholarship for the next academic year, it is necessary to collect 30 credits. However, this should not exceed 20-25 hours per week. This is more than in other countries of the European Union, where students are allowed to work a maximum of 20 hours.</p> <p>Students can work mainly in the service sector, in particular, in delivery, shops, and public catering establishments, and can earn up to 400-1000 euros per month. If the allocated scholarship is used sparingly, it is up to everyone.</p>  <p>As for the monthly expenses, it will cost about 500-600 euros per month. This includes living expenses, utility bills if renting, food, transport and communication costs.</p> <p>There is a discount of up to 130 euros on transport tickets for students. In this case, the student's income should not exceed 10,000 euros. Transport service is 1.5 euros per day, 35 euros per month, 250 euros per year.</p> <p>For communication services, 10-15 euros are spent.</p> <p><img class="fr-fic fr-dii lazy" data-loaded="true" data-src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/02/7tDdlf16775812315138_b.jpg" src="https://www.spot.uz/media/img/2023/02/7tDdlf16775812315138_b.jpg"/></p> <p></p> <p>Photo: Abrorjon Yormatov's personal from the archive</p> <p>It should also be mentioned that in Italy mainly the IT field, including programming, design, at the same time, there is a high demand for medical and legal fields. These are, of course, the areas I am talking about based on my personal observations. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/majburiy-blokda-tushishi-mumkin-bolgan-yil-nomlari" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz website.</strong>
