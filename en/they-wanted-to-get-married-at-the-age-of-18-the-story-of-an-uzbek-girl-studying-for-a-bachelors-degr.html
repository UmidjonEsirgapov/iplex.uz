                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>There were times when I was upset, but now I feel that it was useful for me.</strong><br/><strong>“I brought my books to Canada” I love books very much.</strong><br/><strong>This must also be a very important thing.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>Sevara Yoldosheva, the next hero of the "Microphone - girls" project, is from Ferghana, and is currently studying at the Master's degree in business management at the University of Canada West. He completed his bachelor's degree in London, speaks 4 languages ​​fluently. </h4> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/ejSeeKjUwS0f-urc09ZYtg9GyEJsuscL.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>"I fell twice from OTM..."</strong></p> <p>I grew up in a family of academics in Ferghana. I have been with books since I knew my mind. The family was very strict about our studies. From the age of 7-8, my mother put me in one room and did not let me leave until we memorized the English vocabulary. There were times when I was sad, but now I feel that it was useful for me.</p> <p>When I was 6 years old, before I started school, I was given a tutor to learn English. Because of my mother's interest in language learning, we were sent to various courses to learn the language very early. But I was saddened to see cases of familiarity and the rejection of educated people in most competitions. Or even if English is taught at school, I didn't understand why the lessons were not of good quality and why I had to pay money for a private teacher. After that, I applied for the foreign language course at OTM 2 times, each time I passed the English language test completely, but I couldn't pass the history and Russian language tests. The unfairness of the entrance exams (2012-2013) - cases where some applicants took their tests out of the room and took them out of the room affected my mood.</p> <p><strong>"They wanted to get married at the age of 18"</strong></p> <p>Because I love learning English, I had a strong desire to go abroad. After I couldn't get into the university, this desire became stronger, so I studied IELs without returning to Fergana after the exam. At that time, I started preparing to persuade my mother to go to study abroad. But although my mother agreed, many of my other relatives: my grandmother and grandfather were against it. They said that what will he do after studying abroad, we will marry him. I was really surprised at that time, they were all well-educated, they were academics, and they didn't want me to study abroad. increase One of my goals was to study abroad.</p> <p>So I went to London at the age of 18. I attended a one-year preparatory school for business and then studied international business management at Southampton Solent University in London. I did not ask for money from the house for my contract. When I was coming from Uzbekistan, my mother hugged me and said, "I raised you without a father, you know how many difficulties we went through. When you do everything, remember how much I struggled to raise you, don't turn my face to the ground." This is what I always remembered.</p> <p><strong>"I used to work at night to pay for tuition"</strong></p> <p>I was envious when my classmates went to various clubs and circles after class. Since they are citizens of that place, the state paid their contract. I didn't have that opportunity. After studying, I would come home, sleep for 2-3 hours and go to work in the evening. From 8 in the evening to 7 in the morning, we put goods on the counters in the store. During my studies, I worked like this in a shop for 3 years.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/Hu5GO16wWFx-1Ort7j1NeNW2kgK1grTT.jpg"/></p> <p>I remember once, I paid 1 month's rent for a house and 1 month's tuition, and I had only one pound of coins left with me. I had to go to work by bus. At that time, I cried and took a small video to remind myself: "I only have a pound coin in front of me. I'm walking to work. But I'm not sad, I've paid for my education and housing." I was recognized as the "Best Worker" for several months in a row during my one-year career in the company because I tried to take good care of every job.</p> <p>I returned to Uzbekistan during the quarantine, met my husband, started a family, and came to Canada. Now I'm studying for a master's degree here.</p> <p><strong>I didn't wear a wedding dress to my wedding, but that didn't stop me from being happy</strong></p> <p>Our wedding coincided with the start of strict quarantine in 2020. Since my husband and I are from different regions, due to the strong quarantine, I was brought from Ferghana to Samarkand, and in the meantime, the people were given soup. My relatives could not attend the wedding because they could not leave the region. We didn't even have a chance to pretend to be the bride and groom at the wedding. I don't regret it at all, not wearing a white dress didn't stop me from being happy. We spent the money we could have used for the wedding on the expenses of coming to Canada.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/qBDsRnsYAI5G_Gw_QICVpJVuMCqvp_sU.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>"I also brought my books to Canada"</strong></p> <p>I love books very much. There were days when I was penniless in England. Even then, I had more than 200 books with me. I took it with me wherever I moved. My mother used to say, "If you run out of money, sell your books," but I never thought about selling them. After coming to Tashkent from England, when it was clear that I would not return there, he was surprised when I told my husband that I would need 500 dollars to bring my books to Uzbekistan. But now I have brought half of those books to Canada.</p> <p>Now my son also has a small library. I will read books to him. I even found out which book my son likes by his reaction when I read it.</p> <p><strong>"The desire to learn a language must be strong"</strong></p> <p>I have been to about 10 countries of the world. This also affects the worldview. Traveling increases a person's ability to learn.</p> <p>So far, I have learned 4 languages: English, Russian, Turkish, and Spanish. I can speak freely in them. I learned Spanish because I was a fan of Real Madrid. Since I have been a fan for 13 years, I went to Spain and learned this language so that I could speak with them in their own language, and I achieved this goal. First of all, a person should have a desire to learn a language. Now there are various video content that can help you learn a language. By watching them with subtitles, reading more and writing about what you read, you can learn a lot of the language even in a month. I also have a small charity project in Uzbekistan.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/wH6CdLQtUCSSGtxNzOMRM0ji1nTFZpES.jpg"/></p> <p>Child education is definitely the most responsible. I am currently learning Arabic. The reason is that I want to teach my child the Arabic language myself.</p> <p>I plan to open my own business in Canada. In addition, I plan to start projects that will help mothers who want to study. So far, I have started blogging about child care and upbringing.</p> <p><strong>Education</strong></p> <p>I did not receive a university education in Uzbekistan, but I can say based on my school and lyceum studies: unnecessary subjects should be removed from the curriculum. It's just a waste of children's time. My brother is studying at a higher education institution in Uzbekistan. Mathematics is not required for his major, but this subject is also studied. Abroad, only the subjects necessary for his field are included in the program, and the student has the right to change the subjects he does not like. He has a chance to choose.</p> <p>Also, there are many clubs in the university in London. Whether it's basketball or learning a language, you can do anything at a professional level for free. I would like to have the same experience at Uzbekistan OTM.</p> <p><strong>Advice to girls</strong></p> <p>When I was going to London, I promised my mother that I would pay the contract money myself. The reason is that since I was little, I believed that I would be able to earn a living because my mother taught us to work hard.</p> <p>I am glad that I failed to enter the university in Uzbekistan twice, if I had entered at that time I would not have reached the current level.</p> <p>My advice to girls: if there is a choice between studying and getting married, choose to study first. The reason is that when you have a child, you need to study in order to teach him. I didn't get married at the age of 18, I studied and got educated a little later. I started teaching my 6-month-old son what I already know. Learning is of course important for raising children. You don't need to spend time on unnecessary things.</p> <p>I would recommend mothers who are raising girls to work on themselves. The reason is that the child learns first of all from the mother. It is a mistake to demand from a child what he does not have. In addition, if the mother is knowledgeable, the child will have a sense of pride. This is probably a very important thing.</p> <p><strong>Zilola Gaybullayeva spoke.</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/xushxabar-abituriyentlari-va-11-sinf-oquvchilari-diqqatiga" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>This information was taken from official sources..
