More than 60,000 people took part in the survey, <strong>50</strong> percent rated the activities of the educational centers as the best.</p> <p>In the survey, which of the educational centers provides better and better quality education compared to others, and which one strives for modernity and tries to satisfy the wishes of the young learners.</p> <p>Of the <strong>60</strong> thousand users who participated in it, the most most - <strong>50 percent</strong> considered educational centers, <strong>19 percent</strong> difficult to answer, <strong>18</strong> percent considered universities and institutes, <strong>11 percent</strong> schools and lyceums, and <strong>2 percent</strong> colleges and technical schools.</p> <p>Jurist Khushnudbek Khudoiberdiyev commented on the survey results:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>"Do you know why educational centers got the most votes (50 percent) in the survey in which about 60,000 people voted? Because we don't have a ministry of educational centers. No ministry or state agency controls what is taught in educational centers, how it is taught, who teaches it. No ministry determines from above which textbooks and on which program the educational centers should be taught. Here is that's why educational centers have freedom and they are forced to constantly search for ways to provide quality education. They always follow the principle of the right of the client. if he stipulates that you will teach with textbooks, know that from that day on, the educational centers will also 'die', that will be the end," he wrote.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Earlier, we reported that objections to the test questions from the science of law are increasing — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/super-kontraktda-2-3-4-5-yonalishlardan-birini-tanlasa-boladimi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think of this news?
