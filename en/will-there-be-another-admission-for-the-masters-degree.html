                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>17,100 quotas were allocated for the master's degree in the state higher education institution.</strong><br/><strong>However, it is not clear whether there will be winter admission this year.</strong><br/><strong>For information: for the master's degree in the state higher education institution without a foreign language certificate (at least B2, philology C1 level) documents cannot be submitted. </strong><br/><hr/> <p>17,100 quotas were allocated for the master's degree of the State Higher Education Institution. However, only 6,300 applicants were accepted as students after meeting the requirements. About 11,000 more quotas remain vacant. According to him, out of more than 20,000 applicants, 9,074 were rejected due to the fact that their documents were not at the required level, and 10,980 applicants who were at the required level participated in the competition.</p> <p>Of these, 6,300 applicants were accepted for master's studies:</p> <ul> <li>state grant - 3,238 person;</li> <li>fee-contract - 3,155 people.</li> </ul> <p>This year, the allocated quota for the master's degree was 17,100.</p> <p>About 11,000 of the allocated quota remained empty. Last year, in such a situation, the winter reception was organized. However, at the moment it is not clear whether there will be a winter admission this year.</p> <p><strong>What is clear?</strong></p> <p>At the beginning of the summer, the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation Ibrahim Abdurahmanov said that this year there will be only one admission for the master's degree - in the summer.</p> <p>According to the decision made later, state, non-state and foreign higher education organizations operating in the republic and admission to bachelor's and master's degrees of their branches is carried out once per academic year (between June and September). In this case, it is stated that, in necessary cases, admission to the master's degree of higher education organizations for the second time in one academic year is allowed when the State Commission permits it based on the proposal of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation.</p> <p>Kun.uz reporter contacted the press service of the ministry to clarify whether the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation has developed a proposal for the second admission this year due to the lack of quotas. It was stated that the answers have just been published there, and there is no information on the above issue yet.</p> <p>However, given the situation, there is a high probability that more than half of the quota will be accepted again.</p> <p>For information: it is not possible to apply for a master's degree in the state higher education institution without a foreign language certificate (at least B2, C1 level for philology). Selection for the master's degree is based on the average score of the diploma and the level of the foreign language certificate. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kun-tartibiga-rioya-etish-qanchalik-zarur" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
