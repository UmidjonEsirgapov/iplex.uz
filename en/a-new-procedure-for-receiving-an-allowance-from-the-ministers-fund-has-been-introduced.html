Now such restrictions have been removed, and all pedagogues have the opportunity to participate in the tests.</p> <h3><strong>Proficiency category tests and additional fees</strong></h3> <p>🔹 <strong>70% bonus</strong> is paid to pedagogues who have retained the qualification category or obtained the highest and first qualification category and scored <strong>86 points and above</strong>.</p> <p>🔹 <strong>Participation in two-stage qualification tests is mandatory.</strong></p> <p>This innovation is aimed at stimulating the professional development of teachers and ensures that pedagogues who achieve high results are adequately rewarded.</p> <h3><strong>Changes in the certification system</strong></h3> <p> ✅ <strong>Teachers who have a certificate</strong> issued by the Agency for the Assessment of Knowledge and Skills:</p> <p>✔ <strong>The first stage of mandatory attestation will be exempted from the specialty subject and professional standard test.</strong></p> <p>This change will reduce the excessive examination burden on pedagogues and introduce an evaluation system based on certificates, taking into account their experience. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/endi-sharqshunoslik-universitetida-ham-jurnalistlar-tayyorlanadi-yana-qanday-yangi-yonalishlar-ochildi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How do you feel about this innovation?
