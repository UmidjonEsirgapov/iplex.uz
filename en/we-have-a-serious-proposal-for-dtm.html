The online admission system is not perfectly designed. Heavy loading on the server is not the reason, it's just an excuse "to deceive young children"!</p> <p><strong>There is a very serious offer from the OLIYGOH.UZ platform for the state test center!</strong></p> <p>If you fail to correct the mistakes made in the online admission system and servers, from the following years <strong>We can organize the online admission system</strong>.
