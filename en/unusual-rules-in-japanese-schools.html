                Today's most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Unusual rules in Japanese schools It must be admitted that the Japanese school education system is one of the most advanced and effective systems in the world. </strong><br/><strong>This procedure was introduced to maintain discipline and focus on education.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Unusual rules in Japanese schools</h2> <p>It must be admitted that the Japanese school education system is one of the most advanced and effective systems in the world. However, this system has strict and unique rules that seem unusual to us. Let's look at them together.</p> <h3>💔 Romance is not allowed</h3> <p>Romantic relationships between students are strictly prohibited in Japanese schools. This procedure was introduced to maintain discipline and focus on education.</p> <h3>🥗 Meals in the classroom instead of the school cafeteria</h3> <p>There are no cafeterias in Japanese schools. Healthy meals prepared by the state are brought to the classroom for students. It is mandatory to consume them in full.</p> <h3>☀️ No summer vacation</h3> <p>In Japan, instead of summer vacation, 5-week vacations are allocated during the school year. Even during the holidays, teachers continue to work with students.</p> <h3>🧹 Students instead of cleaners</h3> <p>There are no cleaners in schools. Students are responsible for cleaning. This will raise them to be responsible, hardworking and socially active.</p> <h3>💇‍♂️ Freedom in hair and appearance is limited</h3> <p>Students are not allowed to use different hairstyles, dyes or accessories in Japanese schools. Externally, strict order is maintained.</p> <h3>🧒 Uniform is mandatory after primary school</h3> <p>After primary school, all students wear a special school uniform. It ensures equality and discipline.</p> <h3>🏊 Swimming is mandatory</h3> <p>Every student must learn to swim perfectly. There are swimming pools in their schools, and swimming tests are required.</p> <h3>🤝 All students are equal</h3> <p>The principle that "there is no student without talent" is a priority in the Japanese education system. No one is considered superior to other students. Every child has an individual and equal opportunity.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>These unusual rules in Japanese schools develop in students a sense of order, responsibility, hard work and respect for society. These rules may seem strict at first glance, but it is this strict approach that has made Japan's education system one of the leaders in the world. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/otgan-yil-tushgan-savollar-bu-yil-takrorlanishi-mumkinmi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
