The activities of these higher education institutions were suspended until these shortcomings were eliminated.</p> <p>"The higher education institutions spent the past 8 months complaining about the decision of the committee, not eliminating the deficiencies identified in educational institutions. However, according to the decision of the inter-district specialized administrative court of the city of Shymkent, the decision of the committee will remain in force," the ministry said.</p> <p>Also, according to the Ministry's message, earlier, the country's independent agency for ensuring the quality of education stopped the accreditation of these universities. According to the legislation of Kazakhstan, this means that higher education institutions cannot issue diplomas to graduates.</p> <p>"According to the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan "On Education", the founder takes measures to transfer students to other educational organizations by canceling the license to engage in educational activities or terminating the educational organization," the report adds.</p> <p><strong>It should be noted that diplomas of foreign HEIs that are not licensed and accredited in their country are not recognized in Uzbekistan.</strong></p> <p>  — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/aqsh-bakalavr-bosqichida-oqish-uchun-toliq-moliyalashtirilgan-grant-dasturi-va-tadqiqotlar-uchun-12-000" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
