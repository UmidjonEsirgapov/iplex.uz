                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The first method: according to Article 13 of the Labor Code, other legal documents on labor may provide additional rights and guarantees for employees compared to those established in the labor legislation. What if it is not caught?</strong><br/><strong>So, instead of the 1-hour break for rest and meals, which we are used to in practice, for employees who are fasting during Ramadan, if they are given 30 minutes to rest, then the employees who are fasting will be able to leave 30 minutes earlier.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Question</strong></p> <p>Hello everyone, Ramadan is coming. May the month be blessed. I am the head of the organization. What relief can I give to our employees so that they can legally leave work earlier in the month of Ramadan?</p> <p>Answer We can offer some of the following methods in order to give relief to employees in the month of Ramadan.</p> <p><strong>The first method:</strong> According to Article 13 of the Labor Code, other legal documents on labor may provide additional rights and guarantees for employees compared to those stipulated in the labor legislation. What are other legal documents about labor?</p> <p><strong>According to Article 12 of the Labor Code, other legal documents about labor include: </strong></p> <p>—collective agreements;</p> <p>—collective contracts;</p> <p>—internal documents adopted by the employer in accordance with the agreement with the trade union committee;</p> <p>—internal documents, including the employer's own individual legal documents that he accepts individually within the scope of his powers.</p> <p>So, other legal documents on labor may provide for special guarantees for employees during Ramadan.</p> <p><strong>What if the collective agreements or collective agreement of the organization do not provide for special guarantees for the month of Ramadan?</strong></p> <p>Note that, among other legal documents on labor, the employer can individually accept within his powers individual legal documents are also included. That is, although collective agreements or collective agreements do not provide for guarantees for employees during the month of Ramadan, individual legal documents (orders, orders, decisions) adopted by the employer within the framework of his powers may provide for separate guarantees. </p> <p>Because, as we have analyzed above, the individual legal documents that the employer adopts on his own within the framework of his powers are included among other legal documents about labor. </p> <p><strong>The second method:</strong> According to Article 204 of the Labor Code, during the working day (shift), the employee must be given a break for rest and meals, the duration of which is at most 2 hours and at least 30 minutes, and which is not included in the working time. In the rules of the internal labor procedure or in the labor contract, if the duration of the daily work (shift) set for the employee does not exceed four hours, it may be stipulated that he will not be given this break. </p> <p>The time and exact duration of a break for rest and meals are determined by the rules of the internal labor procedure or according to the agreement between the employee and the employer.</p> <p>So, instead of the 1-hour break for rest and food, which we are used to in practice, during Ramadan, if we give them 30 minutes to rest, then the fasting employees will be able to leave 30 minutes earlier. </p> <p><strong>Third method:</strong> In Ramadan, part-time working hours can be assigned to an employee. This is provided for in Article 186 of the Labor Code.</p> <p><strong>Fourth method:</strong> It is possible to give leave even before the time of use of leave specified in the schedule. This is provided for in Article 228 of the Labor Code. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/4/4-sinf-tasviriy-sanat" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
