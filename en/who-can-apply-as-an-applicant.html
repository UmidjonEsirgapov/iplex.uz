                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The important thing is that you must have a certificate based on the 11th grade, it is not possible to study as a student after completing the 10th grade; 2.</strong><br/><strong>Persons who have already received higher education can easily apply for the bachelor's degree again.</strong><br/><strong>They, like the current students of school, high school, college, etc.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>So, the following can apply for the bachelor's degree of HEIs:</p> <p><strong>1. Those who have completed the 11th grade of general secondary education.</strong></p> <p>This includes all schools, including presidential and creative schools, specialized and military schools, lyceums, gymnasiums, and so on. The most important thing is to have a certificate based on the 11th grade, it is not possible to study as a student after completing the 10th grade;</p> <p><strong>2. Graduates of secondary special and vocational educational institutions.</strong></p> <p>This includes academic lyceums, vocational colleges, vocational schools and technical schools. It must also be completed and a diploma awarded. Someone may have studied for 3 years, someone for 2 years;</p> <p><strong>3.

They are just like today's students in school, high school, college, etc. they apply for studies with their diplomas, not with a university diploma. Another aspect here is that according to the current legislation, those who have received higher education once (regardless of whether they studied on a grant or contract) become a student for the second time only on the basis of a fee-contract. That is, they cannot apply for a grant, and even if they do, they will only study under a contract.</p> <p><strong>Persons from the above 4 categories can easily apply as applicants.</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ikkinchi-va-undan-keyingi-talimni-olish-tartibi-tasdiqlandi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
