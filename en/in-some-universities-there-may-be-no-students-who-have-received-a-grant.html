                The most relevant news in the field of education today was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The essence of this new system is that general grant quotas are determined for each field and these quotas are distributed to the applicants with the highest scores.</strong><br/><strong>For example, a general grant quota is allocated for the jurisprudence field.</strong><br/><strong>This means: 50 grants can be determined at TDYU, 25 grants at UzMU, 20 grants at QSU.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Starting this year, state grants will be allocated not to universities, but to fields. The essence of this new system is that general grant quotas are determined for each direction and these quotas are distributed to the applicants with the highest scores.</p> <h4>How does the system work?</h4> <p>For example, a general grant quota is allocated for the jurisprudence direction. Among the applicants who have applied to the jurisprudence department at such universities as Tashkent State Law University (TDYU), National University of Uzbekistan (UzMU), Karshi State University (QDU), Samarkand State University (SamDU) and Namangan State University (NamDU) are included in the grant. separated. Applicants to all jurisprudence courses will be analyzed in order of points, and grants will be awarded to 115 applicants with the highest scores. This means that:</p> <ul> <li>50 grants at TDYU,</li> <li>25 grants at UzMU,</li> <li>20 grants at QSU</li> </ul> <p>can be determined. According to this new system, the state aims to give grants to applicants who have applied to a certain course and received high marks, rather than giving grants to such and such a university. This means that an applicant who entered a contract with a high score at one university will no longer be able to get a grant at another university with a low score.</p> <h4>Restrictions:</h4> <p>Limitations are set so that one university does not take the entire quota of the state grant. For example, if all 115 quotas correspond to TDYU, a limit will be set. A 50% limit can be set, that is, TDYU can receive only half of the 115 quotas, i.e. 57 grant quotas. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/hududlar-kesimida-abituriyentlarning-talabalikka-tavsiya-etilish-korsatkichlari" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p>
