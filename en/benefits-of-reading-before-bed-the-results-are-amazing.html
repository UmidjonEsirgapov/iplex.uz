                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Thus, scientists have discovered several benefits of reading at night.</strong><br/><strong>However, reading a book without any visual materials helps the brain process information.</strong><br/><strong>According to the results of scientific research, reading more fiction makes you a sensitive person. </strong><br/><hr/> <p>Reading a good book at night is more useful than eating because of insomnia and wasting time on social networks. Also, reading at night is one of the most effective ways to fight insomnia.</p> <p>One of the old jokes says, "If you can't sleep, read Tolstoy." But even in the joke there is a useful tip: reading can actually help you sleep. Thus, scientists have identified several benefits of studying at night. What happens to your body if you read a book every day before going to bed? It will be discussed below.</p> <p><strong>1. You'll Sleep Better</strong></p> <p>Reading can take your brain to a new, sleep-inducing level. Do you know why children like to listen to bedtime stories? Because it helps you sleep better. A trip to the "imaginary world" will relieve deep mental pressure and lead to some relaxation. It will help to achieve calmness from reality and dive into the world of dreams. Reading a book can help you sleep better, but it doesn't have to be an e-book. The fact is that the screen light of gadgets stimulates the nervous system and distracts you from the world of fantasy. Instead of checking social media or reading e-books, read a few chapters of your favorite book.</p> <p><strong>2. You can relieve stress</strong></p> <p>Reading is scientifically proven to reduce stress, which is much more effective than chamomile tea, meditation and a night walk. Even just 6 minutes of reading can significantly reduce stress.<br/>Volunteer participants in experiments in this area are subjected to a rapid heart rate test and several other tests to increase their stress levels. Then they try different methods of relaxation and relaxation. Thus, through this experiment, it was determined that reading is the most effective way to get rid of stress. According to neuropsychologist David Lewis, fabric reduced stress levels by 68 percent. Also, if you suffer from insomnia due to stress, reading a book will help you fall asleep easily and get rid of fatigue.</p> <p><strong>3. Improves brain function and helps to concentrate</strong></p> <p>Social networks reduce the brain's ability to concentrate. While watching the tape, we cannot concentrate on one thing. But reading a book helps to process information in the brain without any visual materials. Without any pictures, you create vivid pictures by imagining text events in your mind. In this way, you will help your brain to focus on one place. If you don't practice concentration, you can lose it completely.</p> <p><strong>4. Makes you sensitive</strong></p> <p>Reading before bed improves your connection with people. According to scientific research, reading more fiction makes you a more sensitive person. The fact is that when you read a work of art, your brain creates an imaginary "reality" subconsciously. Then the brain cannot separate it from the real truth. Because of this, you become the hero of the work and begin to feel what he felt. It develops empathy and encourages you to see the world through another person's worldview. Reading fiction is a great way to understand what other people are feeling.</p> <p><strong>5. You will be more creative</strong></p> <p>Do you think that people like Elon Musk and Bill Geis read scientific papers and marketing books before bed? No, of course. Many successful people read fiction before bed. Why? According to the results of research, works of fiction encourage us to be more creative. It's like seeing a different world every time. You will learn to look at the situation from different sides and approach it comprehensively, understand the feelings of others and find creative solutions to problems. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/rus-ozbek-yoshlar-forumi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz website.
