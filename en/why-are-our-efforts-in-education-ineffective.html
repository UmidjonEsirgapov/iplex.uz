                The most relevant message in the field of education today was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>I mean, there are decisions, but there is no mechanism.</strong><br/><strong>Each leader should deeply understand what is based on those laws.</strong><br/><strong>The adopted document, decisions should be explained and explained.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>Extended The vacation period ended, and from January 23, all schools in Uzbekistan began to study either online or offline.</h4> <p>The new quarter is also significant because it is the beginning after the addition of another ministry to the Ministry of Public Education and the appointment of a new minister to the system. conducted an interview with education experts: Bahadir Ganiyev, Abdurahim Nosirov, and Feruza Vahobova, director of the "Leader" private school in Tashkent. src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ba2_rKRUKqc?controls=1&amp;rel=0&amp;disablekb=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;html5=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;autopl ay=0&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;playsinline=1&amp;start=0&amp;fs=1&amp;nocookie=false&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fkun.uz&amp;widgetid=1"&gt;</p> <p><strong>Kun.uz:</strong></p> <p><strong>- We are talking about a new structure, ministry, updating strategies, plans, and many documents on the development of education have been adopted before. If we count them today, tons and tons of documents will come out.</strong></p> <p><strong>Well, why couldn't we reform with these documents, why didn't they work. What is the reason why the documents, decisions, and laws adopted in Uzbekistan remain only in the ministry building, and the reforms do not go down? not related to the education system. The situation is the same even if we turn the same situation to another field. There is a saying: paper "raises" everything. Before making any decision, you need to think about the mechanism of its implementation. All required resources must be available. The mechanism works only if there are enough resources. To be honest, I don't think that the people who make the laws do not understand this. Unfortunately, I cannot say that everything is being thought out.</strong></p> <p>There is leadership in the government. If we consider the implementation of the decisions signed by the president one by one, about half of them will not be moved. For example, several years ago, the president issued a decision on the creation of expert and public councils under the ministries and administration, but no, it did not happen. Another example: the president spoke about the need to establish a system for publishing and selling fiction. It's been 6 years, but there is not even half a step forward in this matter. So, not all the decisions made by the head of state are implemented.</p> <p>I mean, there are decisions, but there is no mechanism. The same is true in education. I would like to give an example of the current situation. At yesterday's presidential meeting, schools were instructed to introduce a second foreign language and introduce 64 professional areas. And it was said to do this from September this year. It is wrong to do this without raising the quality of the main program for "lame" public education, without revising the curricula. We are putting a huge burden on the new minister, who has no mechanism and cannot do it. 64 professions are impossible. Now authorities, district hokims will receive a task, similar to the Soviet system, district enterprises will be connected. There will be no results.</p> <p>True, I'm not against the profession. It is normal for a school to have a vocational training system. But when we say profession, it is correct to refer to the IT field, professions that require intellectual development and rely on mental work. The people influencing such decisions are actually people who do not know the education system and consider themselves experts.</p> <p><strong>Abdurahim Nosirov:</strong></p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/89dnBJT52WdfJyJVVTrIVL-XDlJXULF_.jpg"/></p> <p>- There are many reasons why decisions do not work. One of them is the personnel issue. Decisions are made to solve a problem. But for it to work in practice, top-down control and execution must be high-quality. One of the reasons why it does not work is that the decisions are not fully developed from above, and secondly, they are not implemented by the executors. Documents were accepted that could not even be executed.</p> <p>Tasks are set when each leader is appointed. In many cases, the leader is working on more shows to show himself off. After that, many decisions are made. Instead of decisions that continue each other, decisions that negate the previous ones are being made. If there is no continuity between decisions and implementation, this situation will continue.</p> <p><strong>Feruza Vahobova:</strong></p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/drRjSSe0TjtyBs5hUxS0IQ7CcjwoBVNs.jpg"/></p> <p>- As a private sector, we are also accepted by the state. We work on the basis of laws and regulations. Every leader should have a deep understanding of what those laws are based on.</p> <p>We should organize education in such a way that every person should find his place in society, be the breadwinner of his family, and benefit the society. Capital given to education serves the development of the country. I always monitor the demand for professions in the labor market, find out who is needed and organize the educational process accordingly. We follow the standards set by the state, but we have additional options. We direct children to professions that are in demand in the labor market.</p> <p>The concept of development of education in the Republic of Uzbekistan until 2030 is very well written. We have studied it in every way. The STEAM system has many advantages, such as personalized education. But even the leaders working in the management system do not know what STEAM is. We want these changes. However, from the management system to the teacher, we are hanging on their necks without explaining why the change is necessary, without preparing them. The education system is frozen, and it is difficult to change it. Because its scope is wide: from management to teachers and parents.</p> <p>There is a negative impact. The more informational pressure we put on teachers and they don't understand it, the more resistance, nervousness, etc. are observed. There is no openness and transparency in the ministry. We don't see the documents. It is necessary to explain and explain why the adopted document and decisions are needed. When we say system, every part of that system should work and be coherent.</p> <p>Ministers are changing. We should not notice that a new leader has arrived, that is, the previous reforms should continue. "System memory" is not working.</p> <p><strong>You can watch the interview in its entirety in the video above.</strong></p> <p><strong>Ilyos Safarov spoke.
