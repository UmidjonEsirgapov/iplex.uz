                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education is this:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The obligation of graduates who graduated on the basis of a state grant to work for three years has not lost its force. According to the news circulating on social media, the requirement to work for at least 3 years on the basis of a grant has been canceled.</strong><br/><strong>President Clause 6 of the decision of June 2, 2005 mandated the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education, together with relevant ministries and agencies, to develop a regulation on targeted training of personnel on the basis of state grants.</strong><br/><strong>It stipulates the obligation of graduates who graduated from higher education institutions on the basis of state grants to work for three years.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>On the basis of state grants the obligation of graduates to work for three years has not lost its force</p> <p>In accordance with the news circulating in social networks that the mandatory requirement to work for at least 3 years for graduates of higher education institutions who studied on the basis of a grant has been canceled.</p> <p>In paragraph 6 of the President's decision of June 2, 2005, together with the ministries and agencies of the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education The regulation on targeted training of personnel on the basis of state grants was assigned.</p> <p>In accordance with this task, the regulation on the procedure of targeted training of personnel on the basis of state grants was approved by the decision No. 58, 154-1, 19 and 02/2658 of July 7, 2005. It stipulates the obligation of graduates who graduated from higher education institutions on the basis of a state grant to work for three years.</p> <p>In accordance with Annex 3 of the Head of State's Decision No. 279 of June 15, 2022, some decisions of the President, including Decision No. 92 of June 2, 2005, were deemed to have lost their validity. However, according to the implementation of this decision, the regulation on the procedure for targeted training of personnel based on state grants has not lost its validity. (or) additions are made and all previously adopted regulatory legal documents or their parts, if they contradict the new legal norms or are completely covered by the new regulatory legal document, or if they have lost their legal significance in practice, but have not been officially declared to have lost their force, should be considered to have lost their force."</p> <p>Accordingly, until now, the regulations does not contradict the new legal norms, and the rule to declare this statute invalid is not provided in any regulatory document.</p> <p>It seems that the obligation of graduates who graduated from higher education institutions on the basis of a state grant to work for three years is still valid today.</p> <p>At this point, we would ask all social network users to distribute messages published only through official sources.
