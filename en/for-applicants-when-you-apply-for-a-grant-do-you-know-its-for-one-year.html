                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The purpose of the news. Previously, a state grant was guaranteed to a student for four years at the undergraduate level, now: The student must justify the grant. will have to get it.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>The state grant will now be distributed on a one-year basis</h2> <p>Starting from last year, the state grant will not be given to a student at the bachelor's level <strong>for 4 consecutive years</strong>. Grants are now <strong>redistributed annually among students with high grades</strong>. This innovation is aimed at increasing competition and improving quality in the higher education system of Uzbekistan.</p> <h3>Explanation of the Minister of Higher Education</h3> <p>According to the words of the Minister of Higher Education, previously students were forced to study on a fee-contract basis due to a difference of only 0.75 or 2-3 points. This caused many young people not to apply for studies in the next year or to drop out completely due to family circumstances. As a result, the knowledge they have accumulated for 11 years and the work of the teachers are nullified.</p> <h3>The purpose of the innovation</h3> <p>If previously a state grant was guaranteed to a student for four years at the bachelor's level, now:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The student must <strong>justify</strong> the grant.</p> </li> <li> <p>The requirement is to regularly improve the performance indicators. </p> </li> <li> <p>Each year, the students who get the highest grades will be entitled to receive a grant.</p> </li> <li> <p>The ground will be created for the training of competitive personnel.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Getting a grant in the new procedure does not depend only on the result of admission. Every year, the student will have to work hard, improve his knowledge and get high grades. This increases the quality of higher education and encourages students to be more active. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qisqa-hikoyalar-yozish-orqali-1000-funt-yutib-olish-imkoniyati-mukofotlar-20-kishiga-taqdim-etiladi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
