                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Australia is one of the leading countries in the education of international students.</strong><br/><strong>Due to high-quality education and good conditions, the desire of Uzbek students to study in Australia has been increasing in recent years.

In recent years, Uzbek students' desire to study in Australia has been increasing due to high-quality education and good conditions. </p> <p>However, starting in 2024, several changes are being made to the student visa application process, including:</p> <h2><strong>A change in the level of English language proficiency.</strong></h2> <p>In order to obtain a student visa, undergraduate students are now required to have an IELTS score of at least 6.0 instead of 5.5. Master's students must have at least 6.5, not IELTS 6.0. Changes in age limit. </p> <h2><strong>Changes in the duration of the visa.</strong></h2> <p>In this, the duration of the visa granted for master's course work was set to 2 years, and the duration of the visa for master's and PhD students who want to do research was set to 3 years.</p> <p>In addition, the <em><strong>"Genuine Student Test"</strong></em> will be introduced to verify that students coming to Australia only want to study. It is intended to stop the number of students who prefer to work rather than study.</p> <p> 👉 Good opportunities are being introduced for those who want to go to work in Australia. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/magistraturaga-qaysi-tillardan-sertifikat-kerak" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: prepared based on the information of the oliygoh.uz site.
