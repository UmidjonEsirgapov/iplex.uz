                Today's most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>If you start after half a year, you will see that there are so many topics to study and you will feel as if you have not studied anything for so long.</strong><br/><strong>Excessive saving of money Self-preparation for the exam without any expenses often pays off. </strong><br/><strong>Not believing in your own success If you ignore the results you achieve and underestimate the value of your daily work, you will be surrounded by fear and insecurity.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>7 mistakes made by applicants who have just started their preparation</strong></p> <p><strong><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/4/1100__Gg2Zo88NTM0YAFhKBZgiz0XDl_dj6kGV.jpg"/></strong></p> <p><strong>1. Procrastination</strong></p> <p>At the beginning of the school year, time seems to pass by. There is an opinion that it is possible to start preparing for exams later. But if you start work not today, but in a month, preparation becomes more difficult. If you start after half a year, you'll feel like you haven't learned anything in so long, seeing that there are so many topics to learn.</p> <p><strong>2. Overconfidence</strong></p> <p>There is no guarantee that even students who consistently study for excellent grades will get high results on tests. Your exam performance depends on how well you master the subject, how well you can solve examples and problems, and how well you remember information.</p> <p><strong>3. Excessive saving of money</strong></p> <p>Independent preparation for the exam without any expenses often does not give results. Do not believe people who say that they will teach you for free or for a very small amount, you will learn through free video lessons on Telegram. The demand for qualified teachers is always high. Rely on courses from experienced teachers.</p> <p><strong>4. Allocating time for other activities</strong></p> <p>To achieve good results in exams, separate your most important goals for yourself. You can spend time doing one thing and another without knowing how much you are losing.</p> <p><strong>5. Preparing until the sillage is dry</strong></p> <p>Preparing without rest and sleep can also have a negative effect on your nervous system and your psychological state. To successfully prepare for the exam, you need to know how to distribute everything correctly. It is very important to have time to meet friends and have fun.</p> <p><strong>6. Being jealous of other people's success</strong></p> <p>It is not a good thing to compare yourself with others. Everyone has their own learning speed and learning ability. Focus on yourself and your results and achievements.</p> <p><strong>7. Lack of confidence in your own achievement</strong></p> <p>When you ignore the results you are achieving and underestimate the value of your daily work, fear and insecurity surround you. In addition, your ability to acquire knowledge and remember will decrease. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/bu-5-usul-orqali-imtihonga-mukammal-tayyorlaning" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
