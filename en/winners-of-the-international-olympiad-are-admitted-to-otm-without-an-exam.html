For example, the participants who took the 1st, 2nd and 3rd places in the republican stage of the main science Olympiads are presented with a certificate that gives them the right to receive the maximum score in the specialty subject in the entrance exams of the state HEIs and is valid for a period of three years.

He will have to work on other subjects himself.</p> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>From this year, it was announced that the state grant will be given only for 1 year, after which it will be distributed according to the mastery, and those who entered with privilege will receive the grant for 4 years (i.e. during the full study period). Prize-winners of the republican and other international science olympiads will receive a 1-year grant if they get enough points to get into the grant. In the remaining years, it will be considered.</p> <p><strong>Source:</strong> Telegram — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/geografiya-fanidan-olimpiada-savollari-tuman-bosqichi-9-11-sinflar-uchun" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
