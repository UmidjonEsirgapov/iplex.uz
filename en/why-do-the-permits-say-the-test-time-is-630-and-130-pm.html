                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>This year, after a break of 3 years, the tests will be held again in closed buildings.</strong><br/><strong>The reason is that the time of arrival at the place of the test is indicated here. is shown.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>This year, after a 3-year break, the tests will be held again in closed buildings. So the test timings have also changed and 1st shift STARTS at 8:00am and 2nd shift at 3:00pm.</p> <p>But looking at the permits, 1st shift starts at 6:30am and 2nd shift starts at 1:30pm. Why so?</p> <p>The reason is that here is the time of arrival at the place where the test will be held. Every year, hundreds of applicants show up late for the test, despite repeated reminders. Latecomers will not be admitted to the test, nor will they be allowed to retake it on another day. They will waste 1 year.</p> <p>If now 8:00 is written on the permit, thousands of applicants will arrive at this time, and as a result, they will miss the test. Because the applicants go through several stages of inspection and it takes a long time.</p> <p>Accordingly, the time of 1 and a half hours ago is indicated on the permit. Come to the test at least 1 hour earlier and take your seat calmly. Do not come late, worry about whether you will make it, run in a hurry and make yourself nervous before the test starts, this can also negatively affect the result. It would be especially good if parents could control it.</p> <p>NOTE: In order to enter the test, you must have the applicant's permit printed on paper together with your passport (it doesn't have to be in color, it can be black and white).
