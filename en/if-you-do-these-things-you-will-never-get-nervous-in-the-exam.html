                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Prepare for the questions that may be asked to you.</strong><br/><strong>Imagine the audience as less educated during the lecture.</strong><br/><strong>Then your self-confidence will increase.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>We will talk with you about overcoming excitement below. After all, exams will start soon</p> <p><strong>Self-confidence. </strong></p> <p>Get a hold of yourself. Prepare well before public speaking. Analyze what you want to say. Also prepare for the questions you may be asked. When giving a speech, look at the audience's forehead, not their eyes. Because emotions are reflected in human eyes. And it can make you excited.</p> <p><strong>Imagination. </strong></p> <p>Imagine the audience less educated during the lecture. This does not mean that they are ignorant. Imagine that no one else knows this topic like you, and that only you know this topic perfectly. Then you will be more confident.</p> <p><strong>Practice with a mirror.</strong></p> <p>When you are excited to speak in circles, go to the mirror and speak the text you need to speak into the mirror. This will greatly benefit your fluency.</p> <p><strong>Breathing exercise.</strong></p> <p>When you are excited, take a deep breath and exhale slowly. Do this exercise 10 times. Then you will be much calmer.</p> <p><strong>Pinching the skin of the hands.</strong></p> <p>This method is effective. Because pain helps you forget excitement. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/attestatsiyaning-2-bosqichi-uchun-juda-foydali-qollanma" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: prepared based on the information of the oliygoh.uz site.
