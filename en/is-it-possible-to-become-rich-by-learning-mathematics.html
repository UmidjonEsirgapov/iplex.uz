                Here's the latest news in education:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Math is an exact science!</strong><br/><strong>He talks to you slowly, works with concrete problems and solutions.</strong><br/><strong>How true is this?</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Math is an exact science! He talks to you slowly, works with specific problems and solutions. He does not dwell on trifles. If you make a mistake in one</p> <p>formula, the answer will not come out, you have to start the whole example/problem from the beginning. Just like our life...</p> <p>Today, the number of students of mathematics is expanding every second. The demand for courses in mathematics is also very high in universities. In order to get a clearer understanding of what a person who has studied this subject perfectly can achieve, in general, what the power of mathematics is capable of, we talked with Farrukh aka Ozodov, an experienced mathematics teacher of the "Registon" educational project.</p> <p>The questions and answers are clear, short and concise - just like mathematics! Thank you, a mathematical interview is waiting for you...</p> <p></p> <p><strong>- What should be done to become an excellent mathematician?</strong></p> <p>- Mathematics is considered the king of sciences. "Kings" are not ordinary people. Otherwise, no one will believe his words. In order to perfectly learn the complex and at the same time extremely interesting science, to become an excellent mathematician in the future, first of all, you need a lot of desire and patience. Don't run away from work, don't look at the problem as a problem. I believe that if you have these aspects, you will definitely achieve your goal!</p> <p><strong>- They say that a person who has studied IELTS expands his thinking range, opens doors to the world... So, what does mathematics give us?</strong></p> <p>- Our whole life consists of mathematics. Our life is built on the basis of mathematics. How old you are - mathematics, what time is it - mathematics, your purchases in the market - mathematics, how many kilometers you walk every day - mathematics, even how many hours you sleep a day,</p> <p>how many hours you work a day... mathematics is at the root of everything.</p> <p>If you know how to calculate well, you will be able to divide your time correctly, your spending will be blessed,</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/5/1100__Pee1q2TcOkT9tt9Cjj7VJZgxotEp9UJy.jpg"/>you use your money wisely, in a word, you can put your life in order. The thinking of a person who has learned mathematics perfectly is different from others. Remember your classmates who were good at math at school, were they different from others? I wouldn't be surprised if they are still studying finance or working in a bank. Maybe he already has his own business...</p> <p>Because it's natural, mathematicians don't get bogged down in trifles. They have the ability to make the right decision in many situations. Due to their positive logical and critical thinking, they can see far, and they calculate the future clearly compared to others.</p> <p>Let's talk about IELTS. Mathematicians do not have time to show themselves and their knowledge to the public, to tell people what they have achieved through mathematics. That's why you don't see them. A person who has learned mathematics has many opportunities, his hand reaches many places, some people know this, and some do not. Mathematicians don't care about the opinion of others, even if they know it themselves...</p> <p><strong>- What is the need for mathematical operations? Although we know how to calculate, is it necessary to stick to various formulas and operations that are not useful in our life? It is a mistake to forcefully learn mathematics just to get a high score in DTM questions. A person should have a clear goal, whether he entered a field, whether he can see his future bright in this direction, that's all, he learns it from thread to needle, learns it. Be the first, be the best, don't think of any other option!</strong></p> <p>You may not understand what I'm saying right now, because I'm thinking mathematically. You do not command guilt, we think so, and the actions and formulas that you call difficult do not cause us any difficulty at all. Personally, I enjoy working out difficult examples, and I have taught my students to do the same. We enjoy and love every training session! Remember John Nash from the movie "Mind Games", math is fun! Because no one promised that it will be easy. Everything can happen in life. If you ever come across this, it's better that you succeed because you understand, you know, than if your face is shuvit. For example, literature, music, theater, art... a person is complete with these. Every field has its role and function in our life. As you sharpen a knife with a wheel, you need to sharpen your brain and mind with mathematics and geometry. Otherwise, your mind will become "impenetrable". If you can, learn it, I assure you, it won't hurt!</p> <p><strong>- Can a person who is good at mathematics be rich? How much can this science cover our financial needs?</strong></p> <p>- First study mathematics as in your question, and then we will talk to you. If you talk to an ordinary teacher like me, of course (laughs).</p> <p>Just kidding, why not, a person who mastered mathematics well will be twice as rich both mentally and materially! The demand for this science in Uzbekistan is increasing day by day. Teach, tutor, become the best expert in your field, and you won't get rich? As for the world. Have you learned mathematics perfectly, "to an unfathomable level" and become a diver swimming in science? Thank you, there are special problems in the world that are very difficult to solve. Those who find the answer are getting millions in prize money. In dollars!</p> <p>Wealth is a very relative concept. The more you chase after money, the more it will get away from you. Work harder, study, and money will follow you. Don't forget, you can get rich by plowing or driving a cart. When you are a professional in that field! Be a good farmer, won't you be rich? Be a good worker, you won't know what to do. It's useless if God isn't finished...</p> <p>If you're still putting off learning math because you can't get rich after so many proofs, see a psychologist. You suffer from insecurity and pessimism. Treat yourself and apply tea bubbles to your hair, one day you will be lucky...</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/5/1100__qdB0OOm2yd9ZnQokLbeZVYDdNXkYeI3f.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>- How old is it good to learn mathematics? They say that the older you get, the harder it is to understand. How true is this?</strong></p> <p>– The earlier you start learning, the better. It's never too late! I have been working at "Registon" for almost 10 years, and during this time, my teachers and I have developed educational programs based on teaching mathematics from scratch. Now all our mathematics teachers are teaching based on these methods. The results are not bad for both children and adults, they are all achieving results that match the efforts.</p> <p><strong>- Today we are living in the age of technology and globalization. What do we need mathematics when we have computers, calculators, telephones...</strong></p> <p>- One of the TOP modern professions with the highest income today is Programming and IT. If you say that I calculate the income of programmers, how much they earn per hour, you will not be mistaken. They studied mathematics very well. As long as you know computer science well, you can disassemble and reassemble a computer and work with Pascal or other similar programming languages. Mathematical potential is extremely important in this.</p> <p>And the phone in your hand works based on mathematical calculations. As I said before, we cannot imagine our life without numbers. The world, especially our modern world, is built on the basis of mathematics. Without it, neither the calculator nor your phone-computer will work. The conclusion is from yourself!</p> <p><strong>- You made it interesting! What are your 3 important recommendations for learning and mastering mathematics easily?</strong></p> <p>- I will give four recommendations. Let one be a gift, a bonus from me!</p> <ol> <li>Find a great teacher, don't waste your time, don't skip classes, if you go to a real pedagogue along with being an excellent expert in your field, you will master the subject very quickly and easily. Be careful, amateur "teachers" can make you lose your mind from mathematics...</li> <li>Don't lose your composure, don't leave today's work for tomorrow. Never, under any circumstances! Make a firm decision, set a clear goal, achieve your dreams with bold action and hard work! In Jaidari language, if you catch it, don't let it go until you break it!</li> <li>Repetition is the mother of knowledge. Repeat the formulas regularly, put them in different cases, and work out examples. Learn to enjoy what you do, teach yourself to do it. Remember, it's a sin not to love what you do for a living!</li> <li>Come to "Registan". We will guide you. Our educational project operates throughout the republic. Take one step towards us, ten steps closer to you!<img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/5/1100__HHa8IzVyscKmxPWmTxEzohbAgCp_5lW_.jpg"/></li> </ol> <p><strong>- Thank you for the interesting conversation!</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/xushxabar-abituriyentlari-va-11-sinf-oquvchilari-diqqatiga" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>How do you feel about this news?
