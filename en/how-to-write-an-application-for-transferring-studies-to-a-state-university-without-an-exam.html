Applicants can create a personal cabinet on this platform, upload the necessary documents and submit an application.</p> <h2>Important note so that your application is not rejected</h2> <h3>Note to be written in the field "Reason for transfer of study"</h3> <p>During the application review, the Working Group must make sure that your decision is made consciously. In particular, those who have chosen an unrelated (i.e., a different field) field of study should write the following text <strong>completely and clearly</strong> in the "Reason for transfer of studies" section:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>I (the applicant's F.I.Sh) to the field of study that I (the applicant's F.I.Sh) is studying in the non-state higher education institution (the name of the HEI to which the applicant is applying) I would like to transfer my studies to an unrelated field of study. I agree to study on the basis of a one-time payment equal to the minimum amount of the differentiated payment-contract in accordance with paragraph 7, subparagraph "g" of the decision of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. PQ-279 of June 15, 2022. I am fully acquainted with the above decision of the President. With this in mind, I ask you to consider my application based on my consent and give practical help.</strong></p> </blockquote> <h3>Why is this comment important?</h3> <p>Just by writing this text, you can prevent your application from being rejected. This means that you have applied on the basis of legal knowledge and consent.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Transferring studies from a non-state higher education institution to a state university is one of the great opportunities given to students today. In order to properly use the opportunity to study without an exam on the basis of a super contract, it is necessary to register on the <strong>my.uzbmb.uz</strong> site, submit the necessary documents correctly and write a <strong>correct and clear explanation</strong> in the field "Reason for transferring studies". — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/omadli-bolishning-10-ta-qoidasi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
