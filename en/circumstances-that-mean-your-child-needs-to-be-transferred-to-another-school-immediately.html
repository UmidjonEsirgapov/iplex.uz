                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Transferring our child to another school is definitely a difficult matter.</strong><br/><strong>Inadequate curriculum. In some private schools, the requirements are very high and the student always finds it difficult to fulfill such tasks. It is natural that there are various reasons that do not fit and do not satisfy you, but strict, demanding teachers and coaches cannot be a reason to change the school. Children get used to certain conditions in a short period of time, and the transition from one environment to another is difficult for them mentally. However, sometimes there are such problematic situations in the school that moving the place of education may be the only solution. Below we will consider situations that require parents to take serious measures. <h2><strong>Inadequate curriculum</strong></h2> <p>In some private schools, the requirements are very high and the student always finds it difficult to fulfill such tasks. It should be remembered that each child has a different level of ability, and excessive demands can be an overload for a young child's brain. A child who can't get an excellent grade no matter how hard he tries, loses his self-confidence.</p> <p>Also, doing only homework and extracurricular activities during the day takes away the real feeling from the student. It is important that your child does not give up his favorite activities, and that there is time for him to interact with his peers and just play with them.</p> <h2><strong>Bullying (harassment and violence at school)</strong></h2> <p><img src="https://daryo.uz/static/2024/04/05/728x546_1_785bcce15376618debce7ed8d628f395@1705x1279_0xac120003_5807515211638271006-nMzJ1Nzu.jpeg"/></p> <p>Bulling usually means insulting, laughing at, deliberately ignoring, humiliating and beating. The reason for this is the desire to dominate among classmates. Any kind of violence and persecution harms the psyche of the victim. According to research, the health of children who are bullied suffers, especially their mental health. Young people become lonely, they develop feelings of depression, helplessness, and panic. Some commit suicide. And this is a serious reason to change the school.</p> <p>For information, according to the UN study, two-thirds of young people are bullied at school. In many cases, children hide conflicts at school from their parents.</p> <h2><strong>School environment</strong></h2> <p><img src="https://daryo.uz/static/2024/04/05/scale_1200-Q_zes43C.jpg"/></p> <p>Teachers' negative attitude towards children, internal values of the school and priority values in your family contradict each other. reasons such as lack of education, poor organization of the educational process may not have a good effect on your child's future. Formation of motivation to study in a child depends not only on the school, but also on family upbringing and attention of parents. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ozbekiston-shvetsiya-talim-hamkorligi-kengayadi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p></strong>
