Such an approach:</p> <p>Firstly, it will have a negative impact on the development of non-state higher education;</p> <p>Secondly, it will increase the level of dishonesty and falsification for the sake of empty statistics in employment;</p> <p>Thirdly, it will increase the existing corrupt situations in granting and obtaining licenses for non-state education. etc.</p> <p>These are my brief thoughts. Maybe we'll have a video or voice chat.</p> <p>So, education experts should be a little careful when making such statements about the field."</p> </blockquote> <p>Kushnudbek Khudoiberdiyev — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/imtihonlari-usti-ochiq-katta-maydonlarda-otkaziladimi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
