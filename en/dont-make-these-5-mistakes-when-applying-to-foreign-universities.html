                This is the most relevant news in the field of education today:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Through this article, the OLIYGOH.UZ team will share with you 5 of the simplest, but most common mistakes made by students who intend to study abroad when applying.</strong><br/><strong>Therefore, before sending your application, it is necessary for the university carefully check that you have included everything you need to.</strong><br/><strong>An uninspired or purposeless personal statement will definitely hurt your application.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Are you planning to study abroad but worried that you don't have enough experience to present to your chosen university? Then the following article is for you! Through this article, the <strong>OLIYGOH.UZ</strong> team will share with you 5 of the simplest, but most common, mistakes in applying to students who intend to study abroad.</p> <p><strong>Brief explanation:</strong></p> <p>Your application to the university is one of the most important steps towards making your dream of studying abroad come true. Any mistakes could mean missing out on the perfect university program you've been eyeing.</p> <p>The simplest and most effective way to make your application stand out from other candidates is to simply avoid making the following 5 common mistakes.</p> <p><strong>1. Applying with missing documents/documents: </strong></p> <p>More than 70% of application rejections occur because students have not sent all the required documents to the university.</p> <p>So, before submitting your application, carefully check that you have included everything the university requires. The documents you usually need to submit include:</p> <ul> <li>A copy of your passport;</li> <li>Previous diplomas and transcripts (appendices);</li> <li>Personal statement;</li> <li>Results of IELTS, TOEFL or other English proficiency test.</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Forgetting to pay the Application Fee:</strong></p> <p>Many students may not realize that some universities ask you to pay an application fee when applying. This fee is called the "Application Fee" and is separate from your Tuition Fee and must be paid during the application process.</p> <p>The fee can usually be up to $85 at many universities, but the exact price depends on which university in the country you are applying to. Be sure to find out more when checking out the application procedures and requirements.</p> <p>Most application fees are non-refundable, so if your application is unsuccessful, you won't get your money back. However, if you don't pay it first, your application will not be processed at all.</p> <p><strong>Note: As we said above - not all universities require an application fee. Just check it on the official website of your chosen university and course!</strong></p> <p><strong>3. Not having a valid passport:</strong></p> <p>If your passport has expired, your application may be rejected or delayed. Many universities require that your passport be valid for at least six months at all times, or at least six months after the end of your program.</p> <p>Always pay attention to the validity of your passport when you travel abroad with the above factors in mind!</p> <p><strong>4. Errors in Personal Statement:</strong></p> <p>Your personal statement is an opportunity to highlight yourself as a suitable candidate for your chosen major and to tell what personal achievements your university studies will bring you. An uninspired or purposeless personal statement will definitely hurt your application. Therefore, in your written work, always cover the following in detail:</p> <ul> <li>Explain why you want to study at the university better than others;</li> <li>Show your interest and passion for the subject you want to study;</li> <li>Give extensive information about your extracurricular activities;</li> <li>Check your statement again and again to avoid spelling or grammatical errors;</li> <li>After you write your statement, be sure to get someone to proofread it.</li> </ul> <p><strong>5. Sending your application to the wrong place or person:</strong></p> <p>Every year, hundreds of study abroad applicants receive a negative response from universities because they sent their application to the wrong email address or did not include the correct mailing address on their application.</p> <p>Read the submission instructions carefully to make sure you sent your application to the right place and to make sure it was received. always <strong>try to stay in touch with the university.</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/avstraliyaning-monash-university-istedodli-xalqaro-talabalarga-stipendiyalar-taqdim-etadi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources..
