                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Become a student without any exams! don't get too excited about the call.</strong><br/><strong>Many people think that they will go on this offer and then become a student.</strong><br/><strong>Actually, their way of working is not very complicated.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>There are many offers, all of them are different. In such a situation, it is natural that the applicant or his parents are confused about which higher education institution to choose. So, let's start.</p> <p><strong>Define your goal: do you need a quality education or the opportunity to go abroad?</strong></p> <p>According to the information obtained from the Internet, there are about <strong>about 200,000 HEIs </strong>in the world. Citizens of any country in the world can study in most of them. But the quality of education in all of them cannot be said to be satisfactory. There are not many of them that are recognized on the world scale.</p> <p>Therefore, when choosing an HEI, first of all, a person needs to clarify his goal. A person who wants to get a quality education and become a qualified employee should definitely pay attention to the quality of higher educational institutions and the relevance of the educational field instead of the world ranking. On the contrary, it may not be so important for a person who just wants to get to the foreign country of his dream.</p> <p>If you think that I will find the necessary amount for the contract by studying and working, and if necessary, I will also financially support my family members, you are wrong. Because in such conditions neither the quality of study nor the work is good. Many compatriots go abroad and suffer financially. Most of such difficulties end with dropping out and returning home.</p> <p><strong>Get to know the "otzyv" given to HEIs abroad</strong></p> <p>Before choosing a HEI, look at its official website or pages on social networks. If possible, post on social media, such as your Facebook page (if you have one), asking for feedback from anyone who has studied at the HEI you are interested in. Someone will definitely tell you about it.</p> <p>Another important thing is to observe the place of higher education institution in the top ratings.</p> <p><strong>Don't get too excited by the call to "Become a student without any exams!"</strong>. Because in the international experience, there is a practice of non-"buyer" HEIs accepting foreign citizens without an examination. The main goal of this is to improve the position of OTM in international rankings. The degree of involvement of foreign citizens is one of the important factors in the formation of international ratings.</p> <p>The fact that you entered school without any exams does not mean that you will <strong>complete</strong> your studies without any exams. If you don't know a foreign language and don't master enough subjects, it is inevitable that you will be kicked out in the first semester. Do not forget that re-studying a subject that has not been mastered costs money and takes time. The money you paid for one semester and the status that one foreign student studied will remain in favor of the university.</p> <p><strong>Remember that the language of education </strong>is the most important requirement - if you do not know any foreign language, for example, English or Russian, and you do not have a strong desire to learn it in the next 3-4 months, give up the idea of studying abroad this year and learn the desired language.</p> <p>Any foreign university. educational institutions ask for language skills. The student should be ready for this. Language skills are usually evaluated through certificates provided by internationally recognized testing systems such as IELTS and TOEFL. But the higher education institution itself can offer special tests, study in a language course for 1 year. This is a mistake. In fact, after 1 year, for example, if you can't reach the required level in Chinese, you will not be able to get the required score by living in China and trying to learn the language. are offering. In fact, their way of working is not very complicated. They issue invitational announcements, collect clients (applicants), submit their documents to foreign OTMs, and perform some minor technical and consulting work. They charge a certain fee for these services.</p> <p>When dealing with such firms, ask if they have an official contract with the TSO they want to refer you to. If there is no partnership agreement, then you know that this company is cheating you. They act at their own risk and are not responsible for any consequences that may occur. All he has to do is go to the OTM website and fill out the online form, that's it. All other information (what to do) will be sent to your e-mail by OTM itself.</p> <p><strong>Do not fall for their promises. Promises can be roughly as follows:</strong></p> <p><em>- Enter higher education institutions in such and such a country without any exams!</em></p> <p><em>- The contract price is 250 USD per year!</em></p> <p><em>- The diploma will be transferred to Uzbekistan without nostrification!</em></p> <p><em>- After one year, transfer to Uzbekistan possible!</em></p> <p><strong>Beware of scammers! </strong>There are also companies that do not have a contract with any OTM and have not established cooperation. We have already mentioned our thoughts on admission to study without an exam. Do not forget that these companies do not depend on the issue of diploma certification and transfer of studies to Uzbekistan.</p> <p>Actually, any person can do the work performed by these companies. For this, it is necessary to search the Internet a little diligently. The conditions and requirements for admission to study are written on the official website of each higher education institution.</p> <p><strong>Another important point is, </strong>if you want to use the services of a firm that promises to enroll you while in Uzbekistan, be sure to sign a written contract. Ask what the services he provides consist of and insist that these are reflected in the contract. Pay the fee in Uzbek soums to the company's bank account and keep the receipt together with a copy of the contract. Mobodo will save you if the problem persists.</p> <p><strong>Those who say, "I will transfer my studies to Uzbekistan after a year", be warned, this will not happen simply</strong></p> <p>First of all, you will have to find a course in our republic that matches the field of study you studied abroad.</p> <p>Also, according to the Regulations, the republic The fact that you received education in a different form than the existing form of education in HEIs or studied in non-accredited HEIs of foreign countries will prevent you from transferring your studies to Uzbekistan.</p> <p>In addition, it should be said that the formalities in the process of transferring education are too many.</p> <p><strong>Protect yourself, do not waste your money</strong></p> <p>Uzbek people There is a saying: "If he has it, he will read it." In fact, if a person has the drive, the desire to learn and the motivation, it does not matter which higher education institution he completes. Be interested in the history of prominent influential people from around the world, you will be sure that it was not only the university they graduated from that made them reach this level.</p> <p>It all depends on your own efforts. Education has never been free. Do not spend your hard-earned money in unreliable and ineffective places.</p> <p>Read and learn!</p> <p><strong>Dilshod Abdukadirov</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/talaba-bolgan-abituriyentlarning-48-foizdan-ziyodi-ayollar" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz website.
