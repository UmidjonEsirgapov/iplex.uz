                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Native language and literature In the case of choosing the native language and literature in the specialty subjects, tests will be made from the following topics: H3: Distribution by topics Native language - 60% Literature - 40% This distribution requires deep knowledge of language structure, methodological analysis and the content of literary works. </strong><br/><strong>Mathematics The test questions in the subject of mathematics are formed on the basis of the following topics: Distribution by topics Numbers and operations on them - 25% Functions and algebraic expressions - 35% Derivatives, integrals and their applications - 10% Geometry - 30% Questions test number theory, algebraic manipulations and geometric thinking. tests are made in certain percentages on important topics in each subject.</strong><br/><hr/> <h1>Test topics and their percentage distribution in specialized subjects</h1> <p>The level of knowledge of applicants in entrance tests to higher education institutions is evaluated depending on their chosen <strong>specialized subjects</strong>. Within each subject, there is a <strong>percentage distribution</strong> of important subjects, and the test questions are prepared in this proportion.</p> <h2>Mother language and literature</h2> <p>If the subject of mother tongue and literature is selected in the specialty subjects, tests will be prepared from the following subjects:</p> <h3>H3: Distribution by subjects</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mother language</strong> – 60%</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Literature</strong> – 40%</p> </li> </ul> <p>This distribution requires deep knowledge of language structure, methodological analysis and the content of literary works.</p> <h2>Mathematics</h2> <p>Test questions in mathematics are formed based on the following topics:</p> <h3>By topics distribution</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Numbers and operations on them</strong> – 25%</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Functions and algebraic expressions</strong> – 35%</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Derivation, integral and their applications</strong> – 10%</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Geometry</strong> – 30%</p> </li> </ul> <p>Questions test number theory, algebraic manipulations and geometric thinking.</p> <h2>History</h2> <p>Applicants who have chosen history will complete test tasks in the following main areas:</p> <h3>Distribution by topics</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Political history</strong> – 50–60%</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Socio-economic history</strong> – 10–20%</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Cultural life</strong> – 10–15%</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Practical tasks</strong> – 20–25%</p> </li> </ul> <p>These questions are historical analysis, requires an understanding of inter-period comparisons and causation.</p> <h2>Physics</h2> <p>Physics tests emphasize mechanics and electromagnetism in order of complexity:</p> <h3>Subject Breakdown</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Mechanics</strong> – 35%</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Molecular physics and thermodynamics</strong> – 25%</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Electromagnetism</strong> – 30%</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Atomic and nuclear physics (optics, theory of relativity)</strong> – 10%</p> </li> </ul> <p>The questions require practical and logical thinking along with theoretical knowledge. </p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Tests for specialized subjects are made in certain percentages on important topics in each subject. This distribution clearly shows the applicants which topics they should focus more on during their preparation. Thorough mastery of each subject based on the planned syllabus is the key to success in the exam. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/farzandi-xususiy-bogcha-va-maktablarda-oqiydigan-ota-onalarga-soliq-imtiyozi-bormi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>Stay tuned for other news in the field of education.
