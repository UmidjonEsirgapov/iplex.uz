                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>It is known that the standard scholarship of 517,880 soums is paid to students enrolled on the basis of a grant. stipends will not be paid during the next semester.</strong><br/><strong>Therefore, if those who study on a grant want to receive a scholarship, they must master at least 30 percent of the program above 71 percent. </strong> <p>However, at the end of the academic semester, students with <strong>30% or more of the "satisfactory" grade (below 71%)</strong> will not receive a scholarship during the next semester.</p> <p>Therefore, if students on the grant wish to receive a scholarship, they must master at least &lt;30% of the program above 71%. </p> <p>❕ Students who study on the basis of a contract will receive a scholarship only if they pay the contract money as a scholarship. However, <strong>stipends</strong> of a little more than 100,000 soums per month are paid to <strong>contract students who finish the semester with excellent grades.</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/3/3-sinf-ona-tili" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: Prepared based on the information of the oliygoh.uz website.
