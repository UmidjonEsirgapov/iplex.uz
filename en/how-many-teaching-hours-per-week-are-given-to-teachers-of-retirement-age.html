Also, <strong>discrimination in the field of work and training</strong> is prohibited.</p> <p>This means, <strong>the age of the teacher</strong> is not the main factor in the distribution of lessons. Teaching hours are given to the teacher based on the <strong>quality of education</strong> and the results he has achieved. <strong>According to the procedure for the completion of classes and formation of tariff lists in general educational institutions</strong>, lesson hours are distributed based on priority sequence.</p> <p><strong>There is no rule that teachers of retirement age should be given fewer lessons</strong>. If a retired teacher has high performance and good teaching quality, he/she can be given <strong>more teaching hours</strong>. On the contrary, if the results are low, the class hours may be reduced. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/bolajak-olim-tanlovida-ishtirok-eting" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
