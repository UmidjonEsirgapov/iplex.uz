                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>At that time I promised myself that "of course I will study".</strong><br/><strong>I also passed the competition of this organization and was able to study medical physics in Italy on the basis of a grant.</strong><br/><strong>My main goal I didn't try to work because I was studying," he says.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>Bekzod Abdurayimov recently returned from a two-year education in medical physics at the University of Trieste in Italy. Before that, our interlocutor, who had studied in Moscow for a while and had an internship in South Korea, believed that he could get out of the difficult labor market only by getting a good education. </h4> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/IWPmchgvWwJiq6U4N3DX-GwXpsNT1iGO.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>A promise made to himself at the age of 18</strong></p> <p>He grew up in Khojaabad district of Andijan province. They always encouraged their children to study, even after their mother retired as a teacher and their father retired from the community office. They spent their pension money on their children's education. Since we are a middle-class family, our income was not that high. That's why I went to work in Kazakhstan during the summer vacation after finishing the second year of high school. I was 18 years old then. Because of the construction work, his work was very hard. It was 2010, when the technology was still not very developed, and we had to carry heavy loads to high floors.</p> <p>At that time, I promised myself, "of course, I will study." After graduating from the lyceum, I applied twice in a row to the oil and gas department of the Technical University and failed to enter. At that time, entrance scores were high, things like getting to know each other, the X-variant, and bed sheets were in fashion in the exam," he says. He had a good knowledge of physics. That's why the tutor teacher offered to help him with lessons. He dropped out of higher education for two years and helped train students.</p> <p>"My teacher used to say, 'The best way to learn is to teach someone.'" Students who did not understand the topic before the lesson started would come to the classroom earlier and I would work out and explain the problems they could not work on, and then the teacher would come and teach a new topic. Later, I taught groups of 5-6 students myself. In the meantime, I applied to study in St. Petersburg, but I did not study because I entered on a contract basis.</p> <p>In the third year after graduating from the lyceum, I entered the physics faculty of Andijan State University on a contract basis. I was also a tutor during my student years. I was financially well off, but I still got help from my family for my contract. During my studies, I took part in science Olympiads held among students and took the second place in the republic in physics," Bekzod Abdurayimov says. then Seoul</p> <p>After completing his bachelor's degree, Bekzod entered the Master's program at the National University of Uzbekistan. The scientific director worked at the Institute of Nuclear Physics under the Academy of Sciences. That's why he finished his first year and worked at that institute for a certain period. Using this opportunity, I studied medical physics at Moscow State University for 2 months and became interested in this direction. After completing my master's degree, I returned to Andijan. I joined the branch of the Republican Oncology and Medical Radiology Scientific and Practical Center in Andijan and worked for one and a half years. In the meantime, I had the opportunity to improve my skills in South Korea for a month in my field," he recalls his student years.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Study in Italy based on a grant</strong></p> <p>Despite having studied so much, for some reason Bekzod was not satisfied with his knowledge. He lived in Andijan, and the people working in this field in the capital were more experienced, and he felt that I needed to work on myself. That is why he decided to study abroad.</p> <p>"There is an International Center for Theoretical Physics at the University of Trieste in Italy, which mainly teaches subjects such as mathematics and physics. This center, together with the University of Trieste, prepares personnel in the field of medical physics. Studying is on the basis of a contract, but there are grant programs allocated by the International Atomic Energy Agency to students of its member countries. I also passed the competition of this organization and was able to study medical physics in Italy on the basis of a grant.</p> <p>In the first year at the university, only theoretical knowledge is given in the direction of radiation therapy and nuclear medicine and related fields. In the second year, university students practice in medical centers in all cities of the country. I practiced in the hospital in Ancona. During my studies, I did not have the opportunity to work overtime due to the intensity of classes and many exams. "I didn't try to work because my main goal was to study," he says. those who worked in Russia in my time showed pictures taken in the Kremlin or beautiful places in Moscow. At that time, I intended to visit these places, not only as a labor migrant, but to study or travel. I went to Moscow, I visited Seoul and Europe.</p> <p>When I was a student, I dreamed of students studying abroad going to class in casual clothes, sitting on green grass. These dreams have come true.</p> <p>It's been more than a month since I returned from graduation. I got job offers from several places. For now, my place of work is not clear, and what I am going to do will remain a secret. But if I can't get a suitable job here, going abroad as a researcher is one of my options," he said about his future plans. field?</p> <p>The field of medical physics is currently under development in Uzbekistan. But at the same time, this field is very important in the treatment and diagnosis of oncological diseases, which are increasing in Uzbekistan.</p> <p>"Medical physicists perform work such as the rules of operation of diagnostic devices for oncological diseases, service provision, the operation of radiation therapy devices, and the calculation of how much radiation is needed for people being treated. In Uzbekistan, there are people who studied in this field before me and are studying now. In the coming years, the number of personnel in this direction will probably increase," says Bekzod Abdurayimov.</p> <p><strong>Zilola Gaybullayeva spoke.</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oqituvchi-sherigining-darsini-qoshib-otsa-qoshimcha-haq-oladimi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How do you look at this news?
