                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Kungirotboy Sharipov says that some private higher education institutions are unable to fulfill the requirements.</strong><br/><strong>If they do not meet the requirements, they are taken to court.</strong><br/><strong>Kongirotboy Sharipov believes that now is a transition period for Uzbekistan's higher education institutions. and reminded that the granting of licenses to private universities has been temporarily suspended, not completely. This was announced by the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation Kungirotboy Sharipov in the "Lolazor" podcast on YouTube. <p>Kungirotboy Sharipov said that some private HEIs cannot fulfill the requirements. Therefore, the granting of licenses to others has been <strong>suspended indefinitely</strong>.</p> <blockquote> <p>"Currently, we are working with existing universities on the quality of education. There are requirements for how many places each HEI should have and other issues. All HEIs are being inspected. If any private HEI lacks capacity and has volume problems, a letter will be sent to him and he will be informed of his shortcomings for a certain period of time. "If they do not respond to the request, they will be taken to court. If they do not respond to the request, a decision will be made to close it," said the minister. The requirements have been strengthened not only for HEIs, but also for state HEIs.</p> <blockquote> <p>"We will also inspect state HEIs. In many state HEIs, the directions that do not meet the requirements will be closed. In the same way, the directions that do not meet the requirements may be closed in private ones," said the head of the ministry. saying that it is a transitional period, he reminded that the granting of licenses to private universities was temporarily suspended, not completely.</p> <p>Earlier we reported that 20 public universities are planned to be closed in Uzbekistan. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/litsenziya-olmasdan-nodavlat-universitet-ochgan-firibgarlar-aniqlandi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>This information was obtained from official sources.</blockquote></blockquote></strong>
