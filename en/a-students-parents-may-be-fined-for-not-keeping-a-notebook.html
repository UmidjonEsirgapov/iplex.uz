                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Because a student does not keep a notebook, his parents can be held administratively responsible according to Article 47 of the Criminal Code.</strong><br/><strong>Hello.</strong><br/><strong>I teach computer science at school.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Student notebook due to non-compliance, his parents can be held administratively liable based on Article 47 of the Civil Code. </strong></p> <p>Hello. I teach computer science at school. If the students do not keep notebooks in the lesson, or if they do not keep notebooks at all because of all kinds of excuses because my notebooks are left, is the teacher to blame? Is there a legal punishment for the teacher in such a situation? </p> <p>First of all, Article 51 of the Law on Education lists a number of obligations of parents and other legal representatives of minors, according to which the above persons:</p> <ul> <li>raise their children in the spirit of humanity, patriotism, hard work, respect for spiritual, national and universal values;</li> <li>own create conditions for the intellectual, spiritual and physical development of their children;</li> <li>must respect the honor and dignity of the participants of the educational process.</li> </ul> <p>These obligations mean that the legal representatives of the student take responsibility for the student's illegal actions. In the duties of teachers approved according to the order No. 206 of the year, the obligation of the teacher to keep a notebook for students is not mentioned. if: — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/universitetga-ishga-kirish-uchun-10-000-dollar-pora-berishdi-bu-qaysi-universitet-ozi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <ul> <li>causes a fine from 5 to 10 times of the basic calculation amount.</li> </ul> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
