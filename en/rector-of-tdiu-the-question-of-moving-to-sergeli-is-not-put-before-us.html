Teshaboyev informed Kun.uz about these and other issues.</p> <p>According to his words, rumors about the transfer of universities to Sergeli district are groundless. A total of 13 objects of the three HEIs will remain under the reorganized Tashkent State University of Economics.</p> <p>"<em>Many people ask me when they will move to Sergeli. It is clearly stated in the decision that all buildings will remain under the control of the university. The question of moving to Sergeli has not been put before us," the rector said.</em></p> <p>He added that the Ministries of Economy and Finance It is designated as the supervisory board of TDIU. "All our activities are carried out in coordination with the supervisory board," said Tolqin Teshaboyev.</p> <p><strong>Student distribution</strong></p> <p>According to the rector of TDIU, next year, students of Finance and Fiscal Institutes studying economics will come and study at the University of Economics; Finance and banking students will be transferred to the former Financial Institute. Also, tax students will continue to study at the former Fiscal Institute.</p> <p>"<em>Students should not suffer from this distribution of faculties. They should study in one building on the same day. Now they will not have to study for one hour in another building and another hour in another building. This decision was made both in social direction and taking into account travel expenses," he said. Teshaboyev.</em></p> <p><strong>When does the new academic year start?</strong></p> <p>Students will be admitted to the new university from the 2024/2025 academic year.

The educational process is conducted in the state language, English and other foreign languages.</p> <p>According to the rector, including 3 universities, more than 44,000 students are studying.</p> <p>"<em>This is the largest higher education institution in the republic. I think there are many applicants in economics, accounting, and taxation. We will determine next year's quotas in agreement with the Ministry of Economy. I hope that the demand will increase</em>", said Teshaboyev.</p> <p><strong>Where will students study in the new academic year?</strong></p> <p>According to the decision, an experienced design organization will be involved until the beginning of the 2024/2025 academic year to build a modern campus based on the existing areas and buildings of the University of Economics.
