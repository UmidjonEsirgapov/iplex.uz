                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>After the COVID-19 pandemic, it was found that the communication skills of children studying in primary schools in England have decreased dramatically.</strong><br/><strong>This situation creates serious difficulties for children to adapt to the school environment and express themselves freely.</strong><br/><strong>Ofsted, which monitors children's education and development by the English government. In the latest report of the organization, it was noted that the pandemic had a strong negative impact on children's speech, language and communication skills.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, it was found that the communication skills of children studying in primary schools in England decreased sharply. This situation creates serious difficulties for children to adapt to the environment at school and express themselves freely.</p> <p>In the latest report of Ofsted, an organization that oversees children's education and development by the English government, it was noted that the pandemic had a strong negative impact on children's speech, language and communication skills. <strong>According to the report, communication and sharing</strong> skills are not significantly developed in many children entering primary school. It is observed that they have difficulty completing assignments in the classroom and communicating with teachers and peers.</p> <p>Ofsted chief inspector Martin Oliver noted that early learning and maths acquisition in primary schools is well underway, but noted that some children are still recovering from the skills lost during the pandemic. As children struggle to understand lessons and make friends, schools need to <strong>take extra measures, introduce special programs and more specialist support</strong>.</p> <p>The results of a visit to 20 primary schools in England at the end of 2023 also shed light on the impact of the pandemic on children. According to information, <strong>some children are currently having difficulties in mastering primary education programs due to the inability to master basic knowledge during the pandemic.</strong></p> <p>The organization's latest audits also revealed a lack of self-expression and listening skills among primary school students. Teachers' unions emphasize that more financial resources and expert assistance are needed to overcome the effects of the pandemic. In addition, it is said that during the pandemic, children's games were held only to occupy them, not for development, which weakened children's thinking and communication skills.
