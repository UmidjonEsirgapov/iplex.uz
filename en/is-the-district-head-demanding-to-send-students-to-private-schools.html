                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>It is said that the headmaster of the district has given the task to the principals to send their students to private schools. The principals of the public general secondary schools were asked by the head of the department of the unknown district to send their students to private schools.</strong><br/><strong>Blogger Isroil Tillaboyev in his telegram channel, reacted to this situation in the following way: "Our hope for education is so high that even the head of the district department does not believe that it will turn out well, he asks parents to send their children to private schools and instructs their directors appointed to educate children on behalf of the state.</strong><br/><strong>The official letter is considered an executive document that must be fulfilled, and its implementation is monitored. therefore, school principals will report how many students they send to private schools, maybe those who did not send their students to private schools will hear about it."</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>It is said that the district head has given an order to the principals to send their students to private schools</h2> <p>Unknown to the principals of public secondary schools, the head of the district department sends his students to private schools. </p> <p>Blogger <strong>Israil Tillaboyev</strong> responded to this situation in his Telegram channel as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>"Our hope for education is so high that even the head of the district department does not believe that it will turn out well, he asks parents to send their children to private schools and is appointed to be responsible for educating children on behalf of the state. The official letter is considered an executive document that must be fulfilled, and its implementation is monitored, so the school principals will report on how many students they sent to private schools, maybe those who did not send their students to private schools will hear about it."</em></p> <p> If you raise a white flag, what should the others do? Even if it's a joke, try to teach better than the private ones. After all, it will be difficult for the people who can't afford the private ones. It's a shame that the leaders themselves will help it." How did the news affect you?
