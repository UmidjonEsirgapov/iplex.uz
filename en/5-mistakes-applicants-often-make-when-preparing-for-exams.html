                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>But it is not like that.</strong><br/><strong>Even after overcoming his anxiety, he either falls asleep during class or does not understand what he has studied.</strong><br/><strong>That is why you should sleep in moderation, neither too much nor too little.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>A person can learn almost nothing after 10 hours of studying using the wrong study methods. Imagine if the applicant gave himself so much and prepared for 3 months and 10 hours, but he was not able to learn anything. Therefore, it is useful to know the mistakes made in preparing for exams.</p> <h2>1. Read again and again</h2> <p><img src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/eFTC-KkpfcZcNslygzCWvsFQgJE%3D/4992x3328/filters:fill%28auto%2C1%29/sch ool-boy-16-17-reading-on-floor-by-bookshelf-in-library-sb10069478bi-001-589fc1765f9b58819ccfc920.jpg"/></p> <p>Let's take the example of Samir from the previous post, who did not pass the exam despite all his preparation. Sameer held his head and read the same topic over and over again. This method would benefit Samir when he suddenly had to take an exam. But in other cases it is not useful at all.</p> <p>The worst thing is that reading again and again leads to the "illusion of knowledge". That is, every time Samir re-reads, the topic becomes more familiar to him. But this is a false impression, this method will not help him remember the answers in the test.</p> <h2>2. Underlining and reading</h2> <p>Samir used to take different colored felt-tip pens and when he saw something important, he would underline it. He thought it would help him remember important things.</p> <p>But it doesn't. Underlining something does not put the information in Samir's brain. This method also creates the "illusion of knowledge" of reading again and again. Samir thinks that if I underline something, it will stick in my memory. When he comes to the exam, he can't remember the answers because he thinks he has a bad memory.</p> <h2>3. Memorizing without understanding</h2> <p><img src="https://img2.goodfon.com/original/2880x1800/f/ef/devochka-knigi-stopka.jpg"/></p> <p>Samir used to look at a difficult mathematical formula, and because it was difficult to understand, he just tried to memorize the formula. In the beginning, he suddenly remembers. But the brain has a feature, if it does not understand something, it quickly forgets it. Because of this, the next day or a week later, Samir cannot remember the formula when he needs to remember it.</p> <p>If Samir memorizes all the formulas without understanding, the formulas will get confused in his mind, making the example work on the contrary difficult. It takes more time to understand the formula at first, but a person memorizes it faster than memorizing without understanding.</p> <h2>4. Studying non-stop</h2> <p><img src="https://cdni.russiatoday.com/actualidad/public_images/2022.02/article/61fded4859bf5b4b8e19bbe4.jpg"/></p> <p>Samir would watch some motivational video and prepare for the exam non-stop for 3-4 hours, sometimes 8 hours. But it does more harm than good. The reason is that the longer the brain focuses on one thing for a long time, the more difficult it is for it to receive information well. The things that are read keep coming out of the brain. You should take short breaks in between.</p> <h2>5. Little sleep</h2> <p><img src="https://www.theladders.com/wp-content/uploads/sleep-sofa-190913.jpg"/></p> <p>When Samir looked, he was going to sleep for 7-8 hours. If he gets 2-3 hours of sleep, he can devote more time to the exam. How good! Samir begins to sleep less and read a lot. Even after he overcomes his laziness, he either falls asleep during class or does not understand what he has read. After two days, he won't remember much of what he read. The reason is that when a person sleeps, even if nothing seems to have happened, a person gets energy out of his fatigue. It is natural that a person without energy cannot prepare well. In addition, when a person sleeps, the brain repeats the information it has learned, that is, you will repeat the information without difficulty even while you are sleeping. Therefore, it is necessary to sleep in moderation, neither too much nor too little. A person does not need to sleep for nothing.</p> <p><strong>Avalboyev Sukhrob</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ozbekistonda-talabalar-soni-1-mlndan-oshdi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: Prepared based on the information of the oliygoh.uz website.
