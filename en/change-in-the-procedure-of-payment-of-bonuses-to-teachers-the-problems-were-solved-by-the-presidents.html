                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>According to Khalqtaliminfo.uz journalist Ulugbek Polatov, in some districts of Fergana region, the payment of overtime paid to teachers from the director's fund in June-August was considered a financial mistake, and these funds were returned from the teachers. </strong><br/><strong>This situation was intended to be implemented contrary to Article 269 of the Labor Code. </strong><br/><strong>However, with the intervention of the Ministry of Pre-School and School Education, this problem found a positive solution. payment of bonuses paid to teachers from the headmaster's fund in June-August was found to be a financial mistake, and efforts were made to recover these funds from teachers. This situation was intended to be implemented in violation of <strong>Article 269 of the Labor Code</strong>. <p>However, with the intervention of the <strong>Preschool and School Education Ministry</strong>, this problem found a positive solution. Nevertheless, similar cases were observed in the city of Shahrisabz, Kashkadarya region.</p> <p>One of the reasons for the origin of this problem is due to the fact that according to <strong>Decision of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 823 of September 30, 2019</strong>, premiums should be paid only during the academic year. The academic year lasts from <strong>September 2</strong> to <strong>May 25</strong>, so the auditors concluded that the bonus should not be paid in June-August.</p> <p>However, with the 3rd annex of the President's <strong>Decision PQ-346</strong>, this issue was resolved, and the bonuses should be paid from <strong>September 1 to August 31</strong> payment procedure has been introduced. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/halok-bolgan-harbiy-xizmatchining-farzandlari-otmda-grant-asosida-oqiydi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.</strong>
