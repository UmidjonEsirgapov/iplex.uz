                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>At the same time, private universities with tuition fees also operate in the country.</strong><br/><strong>Higher education in Germany is free not only for young people in the country, but also for foreign students.</strong><br/><strong>If you want to study for a bachelor's degree at a public university in Germany, the German language is will be necessary.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>German public universities offer free higher education opportunities for local students as well as for foreigners. The state does not view higher education as a commercial product and promotes the view that everyone should receive quality higher education regardless of their economic status. At the same time, private universities with tuition fees also operate in the country.</h4> <p>Higher education in Germany is free not only for the youth of the country, but also for foreign students. To achieve this, the country has spent several decades of experience.</p> <p>At first, efforts to make higher education free began in 1949. As a result, Germany becomes the cheapest country for college education for its time. In 1971, social democrats, who developed the state financial aid system, reduced tuition fees to zero. The goal was to ensure that everyone, regardless of their economic status, received the same quality education.</p> <p>In 1976, a law was drafted to prohibit tuition fees in the country's colleges and universities. But it will still take some time in the next few decades for education to be completely free. Finally, after education reforms in 2015, tuition fees will be abolished in Lower Saxony, and thus Germany will become a country where higher education is completely free. With the money provided by the state, higher education organizations can educate local and international students for free.</p> <p><strong>Are all universities in Germany free?</strong></p> <p>No, not all universities, state higher education institutions are free. However, private HEIs operating in the country independently determine contract prices for studies. There are more than 300 public universities in Germany, and you can choose one of them to get a quality education. In the top university rankings, you can find German public universities. The main purpose of free education is that the state does not treat education as a commercial product.</p> <p>For example, in the QS ranking:</p> <ul> <li>Frankfurt School of Finance and Management - 48th place;</li> <li>Technical University of Munich - 49th place;</li> <li>Ludwig Maximilians University Munich - 59th place;</li> <li>The University of Heidelberg is in 65th place;</li> <li>The Frei University of Berlin is in 118th place.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Do you need to know German to study in Germany?</strong></p> <p>If you want to study for a bachelor's degree at a public university in Germany, German is necessary. The reason is that in many state universities, undergraduate education is conducted in German. English language programs can be found at private universities, but they are paid. At post-baccalaureate levels, it is possible to study with English alone. International programs in English are sufficient for students at this stage. Language proficiency is one of the main requirements for studying in Germany. The applicant's ability to understand academic information in writing and verbally will be checked.</p> <p><strong>What should be the language level?</strong></p> <p>English language minimum 6.5 level (IELs)</p> <p>German language should be at least B2 level.</p> <p><strong>How much money does a foreign student need per month?</strong></p> <p>Studying at a state university is free. it will be necessary to cover living expenses. According to statistics, the average monthly cost of a student in Germany is $864, and the annual cost is $10,334. This amount includes the most minimal and necessary expenses such as rent, food and transportation. <strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Is it possible to stay in Germany after graduation?</strong></p> <p>Foreign students who have completed their studies in the country are allowed to stay. Any foreign student can stay in the country for up to 18 months after graduation. During this period, a "job seeker's visa" will be obtained, and in these 18 months the graduate can get any job that matches his qualifications.</p> <p>Source: kun.uz — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qanday-holatda-oqishini-kochirish-va-qayta-tiklash-haqidagi-arizaga-rad-javobi-beriladi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
