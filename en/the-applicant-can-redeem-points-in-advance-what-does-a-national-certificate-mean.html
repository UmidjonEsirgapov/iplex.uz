Now, applicants can easily score the maximum points in their main subjects before the entrance exams start and enter the exam calmly.</h4> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/hE60ghPJyYDxhlJXkYrKFuvJ6q6i9i5Z.jpg"/>Photo: KUN.UZ</p> <p>For this, they have to pass the national certificate exam in general education subjects. </p> <p><strong>What is a national certificate?</strong></p> <p>Certificate is a test designed to determine the applicant's knowledge of general education subjects, for example, mathematics.</p> <p>Until now, certificate exams have been held in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, native language and literature, Russian language, Karakalpak language and literature. In May, for the first time, an exam on history and geography will be held. The exam is conducted by the Knowledge and Skills Assessment Agency (former DTM). Until now, the sample questions that will appear in the test have also been announced. </p> <p>Persons who scored at least 60% of the highest score according to the test results will be presented with a certificate valid for 3 years.</p> <p>Applicants with this certificate will be awarded the following points when entering the bachelor's degree program of higher education institutions:</p> <ul> <li>those who scored 60% to 85% of the highest score will be awarded the maximum score in this subject in accordance with the mastery percentage in the certificate. graded (proportional) score;</li> <li>the maximum score set for this subject to those who scored 86 percent of the highest score and above; </li> <li>the highest score set for the respective compulsory subjects.</li> </ul> <p>To get the maximum score set for the compulsory subject, it is enough if the applicant's certificate score is above 60 percent. <p> is also exempted from math test questions in the compulsory subject block.</p> <p>However, if the applicant's certificate score is below 86%, when applying to OTM, he can obtain the maximum score in the mathematics subject in the compulsory subject block and choose the option to work on the questions from the main block of mathematics.</p> <p><strong>How are the questions structured?</strong></p> <p>Exam questions for the national certificate should be made in accordance with educational standards and educational programs. Sample questions can be found on the website of the Agency for Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (formerly DTM).

Since the open-ended test tasks are divided into 2 parts, if we consider the total number of test tasks as 55, each test task corresponds to approximately 2 minutes and 44 seconds. 3 hours will be allotted to complete the tasks, as only the essay on the subject of mother tongue and literature is required.
