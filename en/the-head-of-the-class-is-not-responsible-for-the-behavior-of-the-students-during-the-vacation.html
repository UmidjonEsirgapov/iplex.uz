                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>We all know that in the past, only the class leader, principal or his deputies were responsible for any behavior of students, whether it was on vacation or outside of class.</strong><br/><strong>For example, a student during vacation even if he got into a fight or quarrel with his neighbor, the officers of the internal affairs body would call the head of that student's class and harass him. only the class leader, principal or his/her deputies would be responsible for any behavior of the students, be it on vacation or outside of class. For example, even if a student had a fight with his neighbor during the vacation, the officers of the internal affairs body would call the head of that student's class and harass him. Almost no effective measures were taken against the student's parents. And now such cases have been prevented. <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">In accordance with the regulation on the head of the class approved by the order of the Ministry of Public Education dated February 22, 2021 No. 41, parents are responsible for the behavior of students outside the educational institution after school and during vacations.</p> <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Class leaders are not held accountable. Therefore, in such cases, disciplinary measures are not applied not only to the head of the class, but also to the deputy principals.</p> <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">It should not be forgotten that Article 73 of the Family Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan states that parents are responsible for raising their children. They must take care of their children's health, mental, physical, spiritual and moral development. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/1/1-sinf-alifbe" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.</strong>
