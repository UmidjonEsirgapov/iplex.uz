                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>General time distribution: ✅ 3 compulsory subjects - 60 minutes ✅ 2 specialist subjects - 120 minutes 🟰 Total - 180 minutes (3 hours) During this time, the applicant must answer all the questions and finish marking (coloring) the answers required.</strong><br/><strong>If the applicant has a national/international certificate in a foreign language or other subjects and is exempted from the test, the time for taking the test is reduced to the appropriate minutes: ✅ 1 preferred subject (for example, a foreign language) - 60 minutes reduced ✅ 2 preferred subjects (both specialty subjects) - 120 minutes reduced In this case, only compulsory subjects are submitted and the time is 60 minutes </strong><br/><strong>❗ An important note is that marking the answers in the process of taking the test is included in the testing time.</strong><br/><hr/> <h1>Testing time for applicants: what should be paid attention to in 3 hours?</h1> <p>Testing is one of the most responsible processes for applicants. That's why it's important to have accurate information about probationary periods, subjects, and benefits. Below we will explain the test time and all the important aspects related to it.</p> <h2>🕒 How is the test time allocated?</h2> <h3>General time distribution:</h3> <ul> <li> <p> ✅ <strong>3 compulsory subjects</strong> – 60 minutes</p> </li> <li> <p> ✅ <strong>2 specialist subjects</strong> – 120 minutes</p> </li> <li> <p>🟰 <strong>Total</strong> – <strong>180 minutes (3 hours)</strong></p> </li> </ul> <p>During this time, the applicant must answer all the questions and finish <strong>marking (coloring)</strong> the answers. No additional time will be allocated for separate marking!</p> <h2>🎓 What is the time for privileged applicants?</h2> <p>If the applicant has a <strong>national/international certificate</strong> in a foreign language or other subjects and is exempt from the test, the time for taking the test will be <strong>reduced to the appropriate minutes</strong>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> ✅ <strong>1 special subject (for example, foreign language)</strong> – 60 minutes reduced</p> </li> <li> <p> ✅ <strong>2 special subjects (both specialty subjects)</strong> – 120 minutes reduced</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this case, only <strong>compulsory subjects</strong> will be submitted and <strong>60 minutes</strong> will be given.</p> <h2>Professional (creative) exam takers time</h2> <p>Applicants admitted to professional (creative) courses take part in general tests only for <strong>3 compulsory subjects</strong>. Such applicants are given <strong>1 hour (60 minutes)</strong> time.</p> <h2>❗ Important note</h2> <p>During the test submission, <strong>marking the answers</strong> is included in the test time. Therefore, it is very important to allocate time correctly and plan the test from the beginning to the end.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Applicants should not forget that every minute of the test-taking time is important. The time will be shorter for privileged applicants and for those in professional fields. So take these details into account when you start preparing for the test process. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kollej-va-texnikumda-5ta-soha-boyicha-oqimoqchi-bolgan-xotin-qizlar-grant-asosida-taʼlim-oladi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How do you feel about this news?
