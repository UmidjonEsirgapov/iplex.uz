                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Hello.</strong><br/><strong>If a non-state university opens a branch in another region, should it also obtain a license for that address? indicates that he has the right to provide educational services at this address.</strong><br/><hr/> <blockquote> <p>Hello. I saw an announcement about the opening of a branch in Samarkand of a newly opened non-governmental higher education organization in Karakalpakstan. The license I saw has an address in Karakalpakstan. If non-state universities open a branch in another province, should they also obtain a license for that location?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The Cabinet of Ministers' decision No. 80 of February 21, 2022 approved the requirements and conditions for a license for the provision of non-state higher education services.</strong></p> <p>The license of each non-state higher education organization <strong>the address of activity is clearly indicated</strong> and the university indicates that it is <strong>only entitled to provide educational services at this address</strong>.</p> <p>The reason why the address of activity is clearly indicated in the license is that before the license is issued, the building and area at this address are examined for compliance with the requirements and conditions specified in the decision. The address of the branch is indicated in the license of the universities with a legal branch.</p> <p>In order to create convenience for citizens, some non-state universities may set up admission offices in other regions. However, this does not mean that the university also teaches in that region.</p> <p>If the representatives of a non-state university inform you that they have a branch at another address, check that the same address is indicated in the activity address section of the license. order — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/millarderlarning-muvaffaqiyati-siri-kitob-oqishga-nega-kop-vaqt-ajratishadi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p>
