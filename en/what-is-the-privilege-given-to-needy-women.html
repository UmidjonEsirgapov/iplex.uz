                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>THIS IS IMPORTANT: the preferential quota for women who received a recommendation for 2000 places will go only to the FIRST direction. for example, in Samarkand region, a total of 40 women were given recommendations; 40 women who received a letter of recommendation applied to any HEIs of the republic; applicants scored differently; Among all women who received a recommendation from Samarkand, 5 applicants with the highest score will be admitted to the additional quota on the basis of a grant; the rest of the women will take part in the general competition with their score, that is, even if they are not able to study within the framework of the privilege, they will continue to participate in the competition in the general manner.</strong><br/><strong>For example, last year the total quota for Andijan was 183.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Many women are thinking that "I got a recommendation, now I can definitely study". But this is a mistake. In addition to the recommendation, they must score high marks, which means that knowledge is also important. </p> <p>A total of <strong>2,000 ADDITIONAL quotas</strong> have been allocated for <u>full-time </u>education throughout the republic based on a state grant. Extramural and evening education is not <strong>privileged.</strong></p> <p>Many people who receive a recommendation think that "it will add points to me". This is also a mistake. This recommendation <strong>does not add any points.</strong></p> <p><strong>THIS IS IMPORTANT</strong>: For women who received a recommendation for 2000 places, the preferential quota goes to the <strong>FIRST course</strong> only. Therefore, you should choose full-time education as the first course. If part-time, evening or remote students are chosen for the first course, then they cannot claim a preferential quota. First, you can choose daytime, and you can choose part-time, evening, or distance courses for courses 2, 3, 4, or 5.</p> <p>Quotas are divided by region. As of June 30, 2023, preferential quotas have not yet been announced, it is not known.</p> <p><strong>Calculation procedure</strong></p> <p>Let's consider the example of Samarkand. The quotas allocated for Samarkand will be <strong>intended for women who are on the permanent list (propiska) in Samarkand</strong>, not for those who have submitted applications to higher education institutions in Samarkand. Women from Samarkand who have received a letter of recommendation do not have to apply only to Samarkand, they can choose any region (for example, Tashkent).</p> <p>So, what does this mean? How is the privilege applied?</p> <p><strong>The procedure is as follows:</strong></p> <ul> <li>for easier understanding, let's imagine that 5 quotas were given to Samarkand region;</li> <li>let's say a total of <strong>40</strong> women were given recommendations in Samarkand region;</li> <li><strong>40 </strong> women who received recommendations <strong>applied to any HEIs</strong> of the republic;</li> <li>applicants scored differently;</li> <li>among all the women who received a recommendation from Samarkand, the 5 applicants with the <strong>highest score</strong> will be admitted to the additional quota based on the grant; i.e., even if he cannot study within the framework of the privilege, he will still participate in the competition in the general manner. Starting from last year, a separate quota was allocated to 3 fields: <ol> <li>exact and natural sciences;</li> <li>technical sciences;</li> <li>medical sciences;</li> </ol> <p>The surplus quotas from these three fields were allocated to all other fields.</p> <p>For example, last year the general quota for <strong>Andijan </strong> <strong>There were 183</strong>. Including <strong>43</strong> quotas for exact and natural sciences, <strong>24</strong> quotas for technical sciences, <strong>29</strong> quotas for medical sciences. <strong>A total of 96</strong> seats were allocated to these <strong>3 fields</strong>. The remaining <strong>87</strong> places are for all other fields, such as humanitarian, social, service fields, etc. was given as a general competition.</p> <p>There was a separate competition for each field. Therefore, women who received a recommendation last year did not enter with 140 points in one field, but entered with 80 points in another field. This kind of inequality and social injustice was created by dividing the quotas into sectors. Let's see how this year will be. It is not yet known whether the fields will be given quota or if it will be general. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/magistratura-kerakmi-afzalliklar-talablar-2025" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>Stay tuned for more education news..</li></ul>
