                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Diplomas of two types are issued by non-state universities of Uzbekistan.</strong><br/><strong>That is, if the curriculum is in the state system, they receive the same diploma as the diplomas issued by state universities. if the student is teaching based on the standard of the curriculum, a diploma of a voluntary type can be issued if there are documents guaranteeing the student's full mastery of the educational program in the specialty. These diplomas are presented in accordance with state standards and on the basis of their own educational programs of non-state universities. <p><strong>State-type diploma</strong></p> <p>In non-state universities, a state-type diploma is issued when a <strong>curriculum that meets the state standard</strong> is used. That is, if the educational program is in the state system, they will receive the same diploma as the diplomas issued by the state universities.</p> <p><strong>Diploma of voluntary model</strong></p> <p>If the non-state university is teaching based on the standard of the curriculum developed by itself, <strong>diploma of voluntary model</strong> if there are documents guaranteeing that the student will fully master the educational program in the specialty can be given. That is, universities teaching in the educational system that is not based on a foreign or self-developed state program can issue diplomas in any way they want. The issued diploma sample (form) is created independently by the university.</p> <p><strong>No reason to worry</strong></p> <p>There is no reason to worry. According to Article 31 of the Law on Education, both diplomas have the same validity as state universities. This will expand the opportunities for students to study in private universities and guarantee the validity of the diplomas they receive. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/6/6-sinf-ingliz-tili" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
