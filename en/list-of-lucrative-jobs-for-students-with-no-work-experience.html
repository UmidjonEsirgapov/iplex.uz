                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Only here, there are a couple of disadvantages that you should know in advance: This option is more for part-time students (because you have to work during the day).</strong><br/><strong>Being a porter, you can work in the evening. You can work after lunch (if there is shift work) and before.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Why does a student need a job and who can work? </strong></p> <p>Someone has to pay for a bedroom, someone is not given a bedroom at all and has to rent an apartment and pay rent. They also need money for travel, food and drink, sometimes they want to go home, etc. So, a student needs a lot of money for daily expenses. At such a time, an additional income should not be a hindrance to anyone. Part-time students definitely work somewhere. Nowadays, it is very easy for part-time students to combine study and work. For those who study in full-time education, it can be a little difficult. Such students have to work every day after school, in the evening or on weekends. If you also have a desire to earn additional income, do not worry, there are many such jobs.</p> <p></p> <blockquote> <p>The article is written for students in Tashkent, Bukhara, Samarkand, Karshi, Termiz, Namangan, Andijan, Khorezm, Nukus and other cities of our country</p> </blockquote> <p></p> <p>Officially getting a job and earning additional income is definitely a separate issue. Work for students can be found in every city. But if you are a <strong>full-time student</strong>, it is not possible to officially get a job. (Excluding graduate courses, of course) So you can work "<strong>informally</strong>" to put it mildly. Because no one will officially hire a student studying in full-time education. However, part-time jobs are also available for full-time students. Here we will consider the most real and simple options for such work. Now let's find out how a student should find a job, where and who can work. To find vacancies, you just need to enter the necessary query in the search engine!</p> <p><strong>Article editor</strong></p> <ol> <li>Working as a waiter</li> <li>Cleaning</li> <li>Courier or poster hanger (advertisement gluer).</li> <li>Fork lifter is a profession for strong children</li> <li>Freelancer, in other words, work online</li> </ol> <p><strong>Work as a waiter</strong></p> <p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENXB7q-WwAAtXPR?format=jpg&amp;name=medium"/></p> <p>At first glance, the best and most interesting option. Customer service isn't hard work, you get to talk to interesting people, and they can tip you. Only here, there are a couple of disadvantages that you should know in advance:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>This option is more for part-time students (because you have to work during the day). Yes, you can get a job at a night club to work after school, but when do you get time off? You can get a job for such jobs, for a certain time, by agreement. And you come to work at the agreed time, you leave at the agreed time.</li> <li>To work in a good club or in a good restaurant, you need experience. If you don't have such experience, you should look for a more casual restaurant.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>It can be said that the advantage is the work space and the possibility to work on a flexible schedule (where you work according to your schedule). When many people come to the cafe, there is no time to sit down. In such conditions, after a few hours your legs will start to get very tired. In some cafes and restaurants, you can even forget about the tip. even if they give very little, people are ashamed to take it.</p> <p>There may be various clients, they may leave without paying for what they ate and drank, as if they were drunk, they may complain about you, in such cases, they may hang the entire account books of the client on your neck, etc. So, in any case, you can earn 30,000-100,000 soums a day on average. Maybe even more. You can calculate how much it will be per month and how much money you need for your needs.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Cleaning</strong></p> <p><strong><img src="https://get.pxhere.com/photo/woman-water-person-girl-house-kitchen-hand-child-window-window-cleaner-paint-play-1622679.jpg"/></strong></p> <p>You can immediately guess that you you don't even want to think about work. The truth is, most of us find such jobs humiliating. Some are even ashamed. However, if you compare cleaning with the previous job, waitressing, this job has a lot of advantages. How can a student earn money in such a job? The main thing here is to find a good place and take responsibility for new tasks. It can be an office, a building or a government institution. Let's take a look at the advantages of this job:</p> <ul> <li>Experience is not necessary at all, unless you are asked. You are required to clean the trusted place with quality. The most convenient time for students to work is after school and in the evening.</li> <li>If you find a job in an office, it is cool in summer and hot in winter.</li> </ul> <p>The salary of a worker who is just starting a cleaning job, and a worker who is just starting a waiter's salary is quite high. You will save your nerves, you will clean yourself, and no one will give you a headache.</p> <ul> <li>You can get a job in several such workplaces. This will definitely increase your income.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p><strong>Of course, there are disadvantages, not all of them are at the family level. It is better to discuss everything before taking the job. Here are the disadvantages:</strong></p> <ul> <li>When you start working, your back and limbs may hurt. Of course, this is at the beginning of work, then you will adapt.</li> <li>You will not be hired in good offices. They won't hire a street student there, unless you are someone's relative or acquaintance. But, depending on the type of office.</li> <li>You may have to buy work tools yourself. This will be an additional cost for you.</li> </ul> <p>Thus, in the first month you can get a salary of 700-800 thousand to 1,000,000 soums. Maybe more.</p> <p><strong>Courier or Poster Hanger (advertisement sticker)</strong></p> <p><strong><img src="https://f.partnerkin.com/uploads/storage/files/file_1654066381.webp"/></strong></p> <p>So many offers. The Internet is full of job vacancies. You will definitely find such jobs in your city. Today, a courier is needed both in the office and in online stores to deliver products to customers. Regarding the second issue of additional work, advertising is also necessary for many people. We can see hundreds of leaflets on platforms or at bus stops. Is everything so simple and beautiful at first glance?</p> <p><strong>What are the features of this job:</strong></p> <ul> <li>If possible, it is better to have your own car, of course you need fuel for the car. Or, you have to use public transport, and you have to pay a fare. These are excessive costs for you, there may be such cases: you will search for one address for half a day. You will have to walk around the city well.</li> <li>You will get tired of walking here and there every day, and you will not have any passion or time for studying. Maybe even more. <p></p> <p><strong>Carrier is a profession for strong children.</strong></p> <p><img src="https://avatars.mds.yandex.net/get-altay/4439632/2a0000017a191b598a39a7a66aadbb28213f/XXL"/></p> <p>More In some cases, it is necessary to work full-time. As a porter, it is possible to work in the evenings. Day and evening shifts are organized in many stores, enterprises and firms. You can work after lunch (if you work in shifts) and before. It is clear that this type of work mainly falls on young men. I have never seen a girl, a woman, lifting loads.</p> <p><strong>Let's look at the advantages and disadvantages of this work: </strong></p> <ul> <li>Hard physical work is very tiring. Back and legs hurt. You may not know anything when you are young, but as you get older, your health may start to have problems.</li> <li>There is certainly rest and free time, but that doesn't mean you are resting. Be careful, don't miss the sessions)</li> </ul> <p>For all these works, you will receive about 500-800 thousand soums at the end of the month. Maybe even more.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p><strong>Freelacer, in other words, work on the Internet </strong></p> <p><img src="https://static.s4be.cochrane.org/app/uploads/2013/07/student-on-laptop.jpg"/></p> <p>It is possible to earn money on the Internet now. You wouldn't believe it, some people are starting a business to work on the internet. And this means that the amount of income is quite large. After all, an individual entrepreneur pays taxes and reports. Here we will not write about methods and options for making money on the Internet, because this topic is a separate article.</p> <p><strong>How to make real money on the Internet without investment? </strong></p> <p>And I can say that you can earn good money as a freelancer. We deliberately did not write above about working as a seller in a store. Because in this job you have to work during the day, this job is not suitable for a student who studies during the day. But you can work easily during the summer vacation. Such a job is the same for a male or female student. There are many jobs available in the market. <strong>Think carefully, do you need this job?</strong> Maybe you should focus all your energy, attention and time on the educational process? Live more modestly. Then your expenses would be less.</p> <p><strong>If you have decided to earn additional income - then go ahead!</strong> Choose one of the above vacancies and start earning money. After all, work is another step towards adulthood, it is an opportunity to satisfy oneself and one's needs. It's an opportunity to take a taxi or walk, eat or drink with friends or arrange a hostel. It is up to you to make a decision!</p> <p><strong>We wish all of you good luck and success in your studies and work!</strong></p> <p></p> <p>Source: Umidjon Obudov's blog</p> <p> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oqishdan-stress-olmaslik-uchun-qanday-tarzda-organish-kerak" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education..</li></ul>
