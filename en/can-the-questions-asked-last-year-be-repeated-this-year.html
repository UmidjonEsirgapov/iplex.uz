                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>❌ Test questions are not repeated in one day. According to the information published by the State Testing Center, tests are held in two shifts on the same day.</strong><br/><strong>Can last year's questions be used this year as well? will not be repeated.</strong><br/><hr/> <h1>Will last year's test questions be repeated in this year's exam?</h1> <p>One of the common questions among applicants is "Will the test questions that were asked last year also be asked this year?" is the question. This question has strategic importance for those who are preparing for the test. Let's clarify this issue based on official data.</p> <h2>❌ Test questions are not repeated on the same day</h2> <p>According to the information published by the State Testing Center, the tests are conducted in two shifts on the same day. Test questions from the first shift will not be <strong>repeated</strong> to applicants participating in the second shift.</p> <h3>Separate test base for each shift</h3> <p> ✅ Test tasks for each shift are <strong>formed separately</strong>. This ensures that the questions asked to each group are independent. This system was introduced to ensure a fair and transparent examination.</p> <h2>Can last year's questions be included this year?</h2> <p>Technically, the form or content of some test questions may be similar. Because the test tasks are created based on state standards and their main purpose is to test knowledge of science. But it is very unlikely that the questions from last year will be repeated in their entirety.</p> <h2>What do the official sources say?</h2> <p>In the video published by the State Testing Center (DTM) in 2023, the following was noted:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A database of special test tasks will be created for each test shift;</p> </li> <li> <p>Questions are one does not change from one shift to another;</p> </li> <li> <p>This system is kept unchanged from year to year.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This rule will remain in force in the 2024-2025 tests.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>It is almost impossible to repeat last year's test questions in this year's exam. A separate database of test questions is created for each shift, and questions are not repeated on the same day. Therefore, applicants are advised to prepare based on knowledge rather than memorizing questions. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/dam-olishdan-keyin-oqish-kayfiyatiga-qanday-qilib-oson-qaytish-mumkin" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources.
