No.</strong><br/><strong>Only if you wait, when the studies start, the practice of last year can be repeated.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Last year, the admission commission gave the opportunity to study at the master's degree for those who have a C1, B2 certificate, but who could not become a student within the quota, on the basis of a fee not exceeding 1.5 times of the fixed basic fee-contract. </p> <p>It is not clear what this year will be like. If you just wait, when the studies start, the practice of last year can be repeated.</p> <p>❗️Note: the contract money of the women who become students in this method, that is, study by paying a differentiated contract without being attached to the quota, will not be reimbursed. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/7/7-sinf-nemis-tili" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
