                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Applicants who did not get into the fifth course can apply for a super-contract to study and get a contract through the kontrakt.edu.uz website. if he wants to do it, then there is no chance for it now.</strong><br/><strong>Perhaps those who entered it soon may be allowed to study on the super-contract for the first course.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Applicants who did not get admission to the fifth course can apply to study on the super-contract and get a contract through the website kontrakt.edu.uz.</p> <p>Currently, according to the current legislation, it is possible to send an application for a super-contract only to the first direction of its choice. The second and subsequent routes are not visible in the base.</p> <p>Because those who have not yet entered the fifth route are not officially allowed to choose any one and make a super-contract. However, it is expected that such an opportunity may disappear.</p> <p>Also, if those who failed the first course, but enrolled in one of the second and subsequent ones, want to super-contract to the first course, then there is no chance for it now. Through the website kontrakt.edu.uz, you can only get a simple contract of the university you are enrolled in. Applicants of this category also have to wait for a while. This issue is currently under consideration. Perhaps those who have entered the university soon will be allowed to study on the super-contract for the first course. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/yuridik-texnikum-bitiruvchilari-qayerda-ishlashi-mumkin" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.
