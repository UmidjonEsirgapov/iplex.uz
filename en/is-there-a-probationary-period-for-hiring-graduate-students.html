                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Is it possible to set a trial period when hiring students?</strong><br/><strong>Is it possible to use a trial period when hiring students?</strong><br/><strong>This question is of interest to many employers and graduates.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Is it possible to set a trial period when hiring students?</h2> <p>Is it possible to use a <strong>trial period</strong> when hiring students? Many employers and graduates are interested in this question. The trial period is usually set for three months and is used to check the <strong>ability to work</strong> of the employee and to determine whether it is appropriate to continue the work agreed in the employment contract.</p> <p>However, based on <strong>Article 129 of the Labor Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan</strong>, the trial period is not set when certain persons are hired. This includes the following categories:</p> <ul> <li>Pregnant women;</li> <li>Women with children under the age of three;</li> <li><strong>Persons sent to work at the expense of <strong>minimum jobs</strong> determined for the enterprise;</strong></li> <li>Employed for the first time within three years from the date of graduation from the relevant educational institution of secondary special, vocational and higher education institutions. graduates.</li> </ul> <p>Thus, when <strong>students who have graduated from higher education institutions enter employment for the first time</strong>, a probationary period is not set. This law is aimed at creating additional guarantees for graduates entering the workforce and supporting them. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oqishni-kochirish-boyicha-arizalar-javobi-qachon-elon-qilinadi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
