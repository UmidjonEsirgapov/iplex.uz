                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>According to the results of the mandate, Jahangir Khairiyev won one of the 3 target quotas allocated for the city of Ghazgon in the field of pediatrics at the Samarkand State Medical University with 144.8 points and was accepted as a student on the basis of a state grant.</strong><br/><strong>For example, 22 applicants competed for 3 places in the city of Ghazgon, and 82 applicants competed for 3 places in the Khatirchi district. If Javahir Jalilov was an applicant for the target quota from his region, Shafirkon district, he would not have been able to become a student based on the state grant.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>For the city of Ghazgon, Navoi region, 6 target quotas were allocated at Samarkand State Medical University and Bukhara State Medical Institute. But two of them, who had not even lived in the city for a month, were "stuck" by applicants from other regions and became students. The people of Ghazgon are dissatisfied with this. </h4> <p><strong>What is targeted admission?</strong></p> <p>Targeted admission is a quota allocated due to a shortage of personnel in certain regions and directions. For example, there is a shortage of doctors in Ghazgon, Navoi region. In order to fill this shortage, a target quota will be allocated on the basis of a state grant to the medical higher education institutions for applicants from the Gozgon region.</p> <p>It is up to the applicant to apply for the target quota or not: if he wants to, he must specify that he wants to participate in the target admission while submitting the document.</p> <p>The target quota is different from the general quota. point of view, even with a lower score, it is possible to study on the basis of a state grant. But then the student must work in his region for a certain period of time and only after that he will receive his diploma.</p> <p><strong>Less competition, more opportunities</strong></p> <p>The possibility of becoming a student of the applicant who participated in targeted admission is much higher than the general quota. The reason is that there is less competition. </p> <p>For example, in the 2023/2024 academic year, Samarkand State Medical University allocated 3 target quotas for the city of Ghazgon in the field of pediatrics. 22 applicants applied for these positions. This means that 7-8 applicants competed for each place.</p> <p>According to the general quota, more than 9,200 applicants took the state exam for 92 places (22 state grants, 70 payment contracts) in the field of pediatrics of Samarkand State Medical University. That is, 100 applicants competed for 1 place.</p> <p><strong>Khayriyev instead of Nusratova</strong></p> <p>"Stealing" the target quota is very simple: before submitting an application to the OTM, the applicant registers in an apartment for permanent residence in that area. Then, when he submits the document, he indicates that address and participates in the target admission.</p> <p>According to the results of the mandate, Jahangir Khairiyev won one of the 3 target quotas allocated for the city of Ghazgon in the field of pediatrics at the Samarkand State Medical University with 144.8 points and was accepted as a student on the basis of a state grant. With this score, he could not be admitted to study in the general quota even under a payment contract. Because the passing score for this course was 161.7 points for the state grant, and 150.8 points for the payment contract.</p> <p>If the targeted admission requirements were followed, a girl named Ozoda Nusratova, who scored 99.9 points in the exam, living in Marmarabad neighborhood of Ghazgon city, should have been accepted as a student. </p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/dSaow5LibJRKajR-MPCZCtn-92dFSqvs.jpg"/> <img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/bREWNDF669wDlxCeFYImBbEyjGeakg_3.jpg"/></p> <p>Sababi, Navoi Region IIB Migration and Citizenship Department according to information, Jahangir Khairiyev did not live in the city of Ghazgon for even 1 month. On July 19 of this year, he was permanently registered at house 36, Asia Street, Marmarabad neighborhood of the city, and was deregistered from this address on August 14. According to the Kun.uz source, Jahangir Khairiyev lived in the Khatirchi district of the Navoi region. src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/G2_3y7SSjDlHlKrZootgO879yO9mf6QE.jpg"/&gt;</p> <p>Actually, Samarkand State Medical University has allocated 3 target quotas in pediatrics for Khatirchi district. The question arises as to why this applicant became a candidate for the target quota of the city of Ghazgon. The answer is simple: due to the large population and number of schools in the Khatirchi district, the competition for the target quota will be stronger. For example, 22 applicants competed for 3 seats in Ghazgon city, and 82 applicants competed for 3 seats in Khatirchi district. src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/fmNHZYr6gvIyRWJP96kJepRuAFCAmbBW.jpg"/&gt;</p> <p><strong>Jalilov instead of Sulaymonova</strong></p> <p>3 target quotas have been allocated to the city of Gozgon in the direction of treatment at the Bukhara State Medical Institute. One of them was taken by Javahir Jalilov with 150.7 points (in the general quota, the passing score for this course based on the state grant was 167.3). An applicant named Nurshoda Sulaimanova, originally from Ghazgon, living in Gulistan neighborhood, who scored 114.1 points, was to be accepted. The reason is that according to the above information of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship of the IIB of Navoi region, Jawahir Jalilov was originally from Shafirkon district of Bukhara region. On July 18 of this year, he was permanently registered at house 86 on Tovoqsoy street, Gulistan neighborhood, Ghazgon city. However, he left this address on July 29.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/x2rCJhUMEUaGKgEKFGF6q6WrTX1AljtT.jpg"/></p> <p>Interestingly, in this institute and in the same direction, 3 target quotas were allocated to Shafirkon district. However, 107 applicants competed from Shofikron, not 24 as in the city of Ghazgon. If Jawahir Jalilov was an applicant for the target quota from his region, that is, Shofirkon district, he would not have been able to become a student on the basis of a state grant with 150.7 points. Because here the applicant who got the third target quota scored 165.4 points.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/QAaGVwmMBlMGEszLbjjr_L5s114FXs-0.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>Ghozgon residents are dissatisfied</strong></p> <p>Several responsible organizations have been contacted regarding the situation. However, no definite answer was received. The Agency for Evaluation of Knowledge and Skills under the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation stated that if the applicants are on the permanent list in the city of Gozgon, it has no legal authority not to recommend them to students based on the targeted admission quotas.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/MFU1cRDbgsFwqp6UcKlc42dkzjUYtjEv.jpg"/></p> <p>The people of Gozgon insist that this situation is unfair, that the target quota allocated for the city should be used by the youth of this region. Jalilov or charity, who guarantees that Jahangir Khairiyev will come to Ghazgon and become a doctor after graduation? We will continue to search for the lost logic.</p> <p><strong>Ruslan Saburov,</strong></p> <p><strong>Kun.uz</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/talim-krediti-kimlarga-beriladi-va-uni-olish-tartibi-qanday" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
