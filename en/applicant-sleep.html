                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Therefore, try not to get too much debt in your sleep.</strong><br/><strong>In the three-stage non-KTH sleep listed above, a person does not have any dreams. "movie" will start showing.</strong><br/><strong>KTH needs at least 70-90 minutes to fall asleep, and then at least 3 hours of KTH sleep!</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Many applicants try to limit their sleep because "I have to study". For example, among my students, there are those who try to devote 3-4 hours of sleep a day to study. Although this choice of theirs seems good from the point of view of getting more knowledge by sleeping less, it is very harmful in terms of negative consequences such as negative health effects and decreased desire to learn. class="editable_text" data-placeholder="Caption (optional)"&gt;  <p>What is sleep? When we sleep, our body is in full "self-healing, self-repair" mode, and while we dream, our brain is busy repairing all the parts of our body. Just as a disease is cured, sleep also cures the "diseases" of tiredness acquired during the day in the human body. The body needs enough time, i.e. enough sleep, for this self-restoration process to be fully implemented. If the body does not rest enough time, it will not be able to fully restore itself, the fatigue will not be fully repaired, and as a result, we will be sleepy and walk around like a sick person during the day. Many things may seem more interesting to us when we are awake than when we are sleeping, but we must not forget that the time a person spends in sleep is very useful for his health. How many hours of sleep is enough for someone depends on our "biological clock" located in our body. Everyone has such a watch. For some people, 9 hours of sleep per day is considered the average rest time, while others can stay refreshed all day even with 7 hours of sleep. If even 1 hour of sleep falls short of the level required by your biological clock, this situation can cause you to lose focus during the day, lose your memory, get easily distracted, and even overeat and gain weight.</p> <p>Human sleep patterns are very difficult to change. For example, if you have been going to bed at 10 pm for several months, but suddenly you change your bedtime to 12 pm or even later, your body will have a hard time adjusting to this change. Therefore, it is necessary to regulate and organize sleep as much as possible.</p> <p>Mostly, applicants study hard during the week, study without sleeping at night, and on weekends, for example, on Sunday, they try to sleep all day long. With this, they try to pay off the "debt" of a week's sleep. That's right, if you've gone into debt by cutting back on sleep for a week, you can pay it back by getting more sleep on the weekend. But remember, you can't get rid of a week's worth of sleep debt in one day! Therefore, try not to have too much sleep debt.</p> <p><strong>HOW LONG SHOULD YOU SLEEP?</strong> The quality of sleep is more important than the duration of sleep. You can sleep 9 hours in uncomfortable conditions and feel tired during the day. But a person who rests for 5 hours in a very comfortable, dark, cool, quiet and noiseless room can feel much better than you. Therefore, pay attention not to the number of hours of sleep, but to the quality. Keep your sleeping area clean, make sure the room is airy, dark and protected from noise. No one should wake you up unnecessarily during your sleep. If your sleep is interrupted several times during the night, your sleeping pattern may be disturbed and as a result, your body will not be able to complete the process of self-restoration.</p> <p>How do you know your biological clock and how many hours of sleep you need per night? The following situations indicate that a person did not sleep enough at night and generally does not observe the sleeping hours:</p> <ul> <li>if an alarm clock is necessary to wake up on time;</li> <li>if it is necessary to nap for a few minutes even after turning off the alarm clock;</li> <li>if it is very difficult to get up in the morning;</li> <li>mornings are relaxed and only if he is busy with dreams about lying down;</li> <li>falls asleep in warm rooms, meetings and classes, especially when the teacher is talking;</li> <li>falls asleep in the car and after eating;</li> <li>if it is not possible to continue working without taking a nap;</li> <li>falls asleep quickly in the evening and falls asleep while watching TV;</li> <li>rest if you need to sleep all day on weekends;</li> <li>falls asleep within 5 minutes of going to bed.</li> </ul> <p>If you have at least three of the above situations, then you are not getting the hours of sleep you need. This can be very dangerous for you. For now, you can continue to study while struggling with the above conditions, but soon the above condition will cause your health to deteriorate. Try to organize your sleep time as much as possible.</p> <p><strong>STAGES OF SLEEP AND "KTH" SLEEP.</strong> Sleep is divided into several important stages. Everyone goes through these stages when they go to sleep at night. If they disturb your sleep or wake you up during the night, some important stages of sleep may be missed. And this, as mentioned above, leads to slowness of human activity during the day.</p> <p>The main two parts of sleep are divided into non-KTH and KTH parts. KTH is considered "irregular eye movement" (REM - Rapid Ee Movement), which begins when a person falls into deep sleep. In this case, the person's eyes move continuously and irregularly.</p> <p>The first non-KTH stage consists of three parts:</p> <p>KTH sleep occurs after the above three conditions have completely passed. The above three cases take an average of 70-90 minutes, so it is reasonable to say that CTH occurs 70-90 minutes after sleeping. Dreaming begins in the sleep phase of KTH. In the above-mentioned three-stage sleep without KTH, a person does not have any dreams, and after entering the full KTH sleep stage, the human brain begins to show its own "movie". During this stage of sleep, the muscles of the arms and legs are very relaxed. The human body becomes almost lifeless. This is the most important stage of sleep for everyone - KTH sleep.</p> <p>Try not to disturb your sleep for 70-90 minutes after going to bed. Because once you wake up, you have to go through the stages of sleep all over again to get into the KTH stage of sleep. If you don't get enough sleep, your body's energy will not be restored and you will not sleep at all.</p> <p>The quality of sleep does not depend only on the room where a person sleeps and the hours of sleep. Your bad, harmful habits during the day will have a negative effect on your sleep at night. If you smoke, drink alcohol, your night's sleep will not do your body any good. Because he only fights with the consequences of harmful effects during the day and does not have time to rest. In general, it is stupid for an applicant to smoke or drink alcohol. Because a student of science should only try to learn and strive to enter a higher educational institution. The vices of smoking and drinking, which are completely harmful to anyone, are one of the biggest enemies of a person who studies science.</p> <p><strong>SLEEP ADVICE FOR APPLICANTS.</strong> If you have a lot of classes, you have no choice but to spend your nights reading books, if you are not in a position to sleep full hours of your sleep, arrange your sleep by following the following tips:</p> <ul> <li>always try to sleep KTH sleep. Remember that your body needs at least 3 hours of regular sleep each night. It takes at least 70-90 minutes to fall into deep sleep, followed by at least 3 hours of deep sleep! Measure your sleep accurately and restore your strength for learning;</li> <li>try to free yourself from the burdens and pay off your sleep debts as soon as you can. Don't forget that you won't be able to learn the lessons well if you wander around without sleep during the day;</li> <li>pay attention to the quality of your bedroom. keep distractions away from your bedroom;</li> <li>don't indulge in harmful habits. Do not forget that all useless things are harmful for you!</li> </ul> <p>Sleep is invaluable in learning. Relaxation cures all your tiredness and daily stress. It is as important for applicants to study, learn, and gain knowledge as it is for them to enter higher educational institutions, and their sleep and rest are just as important for their health. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/el-yurt-umidi-jamgarmasining-stipendiyasida-magistrlar-uchun-yosh-senzi-nega-ozgartirildi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p></p>
