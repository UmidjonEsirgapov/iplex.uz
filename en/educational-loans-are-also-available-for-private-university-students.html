                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Educational loans for those who study on the basis of a payment contract are allocated not only to students of state HEIs, but also to students of private HEIs.</strong><br/><strong>Who can get a loan? including students of private and foreign higher, secondary specialized and professional educational organizations and their branches.  <p><strong>Who can get a loan?</strong></p> <p>Students of higher, secondary special and professional educational institutions in the Republic, including private and foreign higher, secondary special and professional educational organizations and their branches. Those who "perevod" their studies can also get a loan. </p> <p>In this case, the student submits the contract paper (a contract concluded with the HEI) to the bank and can get a loan equal to the amount of the one-year contract. </p> <p><strong>However, no super-contract loan will be granted.</strong> </p> <p>The principal of the student loan will be repaid over a period of 7 years, starting from the seventh month after the end of the student's formal study period. It is possible to pay off the loan before the due date. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kun-tartibiga-rioya-etish-qanchalik-zarur" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p></strong>
