                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>This will greatly help you master the subjects.</strong><br/><strong>Studies show that it is necessary to take a certain break between lessons and revision.</strong><br/><strong>However, this can hinder the absorption of information in the brain.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Introduction exams include memory, focus, and even mood-enhancing techniques that are essential for all applicants. It will be useful to know them.</p> <p>The BBC drew on the opinions of neurobiologists, psychologists, nutritionists and teachers and students to compile a list of tips that can help applicants succeed. We will talk about them in detail below. Come on, let's go!</p> <p></p> <p><strong>1. Breakfast and "food for the brain"</strong></p> <p><img src="https://foodmatterslive.com/app/uploads/2021/09/Young-people-eating-fruit-and-vegetables.jpg"/></p> <p>The body needs energy to function properly. And the brain's ability to concentrate depends on a stable source of energy in the form of glucose.</p> <p>Studies show that students who skip breakfast are better able to focus on one point during exams and remember information well. whole grain bread or low-sugar muesli.</p> <p>Also, breakfast should contain a certain amount of protein: a small amount of milk, yogurt or eggs.</p> <p>These products have been proven to have a positive effect on brain activity: eggs, fish, whole grains, dark green vegetables such as cabbage, spinach and broccoli, tomatoes and avocados.</p> <p>Contain antioxidants and drinks containing anthocyanins can improve memory and mood for a short time. These substances are also found in blueberries, strawberries, walnuts, olives, pumpkin seeds and dark chocolate.</p> <p><strong>2. Start it all early</strong></p> <p><strong><img src="https://a.allegroimg.com/original/11776a/2bd9f48c4809a2c3e59af951c3ae/ORTOPEDYCZNA-PODUSZKA-TERMOPLASTYCZNA-MEDYCZNA-2W1-Cechy-dodatkowe-antyalergiczna-spanie-na-boku-spanie-na-plecach-zdejmowany-pokrowiec"/></strong></p> <p>Try to start preparing several months before the exams, not just before them. Then your self-confidence will increase.</p> <p>Prepare lessons early in the morning. At this time, the brain is sufficiently rested. Don't leave most of the lessons for the afternoon.</p> <p>The best thing is to make a schedule of lessons for yourself, try to start and finish studying at the same time every day. This will greatly help you master the subjects.</p> <p><strong>3. Determine exactly what to focus on</strong></p> <p><strong><img src="https://loverust.ru/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/82187_termomat-teplolyuks-alumia-375-v-scaled.jpg"/></strong></p> <p>What kind of exam are you preparing for? Written, oral or in the form of a test?</p> <p>Each type of exam requires different preparation methods.</p> <p>It is not necessary to study all subjects carefully for a written-creative exam. It is enough to study the subject in the center of the exam in depth.</p> <p>For a multiple-choice exam, it is necessary to seriously understand the curriculum.</p> <p><strong>4. Make a plan</strong></p> <p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CqZdn16EQBE/maxresdefault.jpg"/></p> <p>For most students, sticking to a plan can be difficult, but it can save a lot of time.</p> <p>If you make a plan, you won't waste a minute of time trying to decide which one to start after one lesson. you won't spend.</p> <p>However, the plan should be clear and thorough. Include not only which subjects to study in order, but also topics and notes.</p> <p>And don't forget to take breaks, play sports, and socialize with people.</p> <p><strong>5. Break is your best assistant</strong></p> <p><strong><img src="https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/09095142/students-1500x1000-1.png"/></strong></p> <p>Be sure to have a break between classes. Studying science for one hour for 10 days is more effective than studying science for 10 hours in one day.</p> <p>There is a saying that repetition is the mother of knowledge. But don't try to repeat the lesson immediately. Research shows that a certain break should be taken between studying and reviewing.</p> <p>The time allows the learned information to be remembered to a certain extent, and during the repetition after the break, the information is better embedded in the brain.</p> <p>This method is recognized as "one of the most reliable in the history of memory research".</p> <p>But relying on only one method to excel in the exam </p> <p>Writing down important information, conducting group question-and-answer sessions, and recording and replaying these conversations will also greatly increase retention. </p> <p>Also, don't spend too much time on repetition and memorization methods that are popular but have been proven to be of little benefit by research. </p> <p>For example, highlighting sentences in a book with colored markers is almost ineffective. proven.</p> <p><strong>6. Test yourself constantly</strong></p> <p><img src="https://media.rbcdn.ru/media/news/bruce-mars-fwvmhuawby-unsplash_85LtuNu.jpg"/></p> <p>According to the world's leading psychologists and neurobiologists, "self-examination" can be one of the most effective ways to absorb information.</p> <p>Questioning yourself based on what you have learned will help you understand the topic more deeply and clearly.</p> <p>Before the exam, test yourself several times in practice tests and try to identify your weak points.</p> <p><strong>7. Become a teacher</strong></p> <p><strong><img src="https://www.expatica.com/app/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/teacher-helping-primary-school-students.jpg"/></strong></p> <p>So, you have studied the topic, repeated it based on the above methods and tested yourself. So, what should be done now?</p> <p>Of course, try to teach others what you have learned.</p> <p>Memory and memorization ability will increase dramatically. The reason is that in order for you to explain the topic to others, you must first of all master it yourself.</p> <p><strong>8. Hide the phone</strong></p> <p><strong><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cs-Are0UsAAvpOu.jpg"/></strong></p> <p>There is no point in arguing that smartphones are the closest assistant in the modern world.</p> <p>However, smartphones can become the biggest distraction during exam preparation.</p> <p>"Missing an important event There is no question that you will become a "slave" of social networks and messengers under the influence of "Fear of missing out effect".</p> <p>Therefore, before starting preparations, hide your phone somewhere until the exam.</p> <p><strong>9. Less music, more silence</strong></p> <p> However, this can hinder the assimilation of information in the brain.</p> <p>Try to ensure that there is silence around during the lesson.</p> <p><strong>10.

Physical exercise improves blood circulation and provides more oxygen to the brain. After all, a clear mind is necessary for the exam.</p> <p>Walking in the heart of nature calms a person and increases self-confidence.</p> <p><strong>11. Get enough sleep</strong></p> <p><strong><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0993/1322/files/Student.jpg?9337369939572718095"/></strong></p> <p>You need to sleep well the day before the exam.</p> <p>Try to go to bed as early as possible during the preparation period. do it Then, you will be able to sleep well and get up early, and you will have time to do the planned work for the whole day.
