                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>You know, since 2 years, a part of students' rent expenses were covered from the state budget. 50% of the monthly rent paid by 60% of the students of the state higher education institutions living on the basis of the right to rent was determined to be reimbursed from the state budget. Starting from May 1, 2021, 60% of the students of state higher education institutions who live on the basis of the right to rent in a house that is not covered by a dormitory and does not belong to them, including their parents (legal representatives), will be reimbursed 50% of the monthly rent paid by them from the State budget. <p>According to the received information, this procedure is being changed. That is, a single exact amount is determined for students who are on rent. In this case, the rent:</p> <ul> <li><strong>In the city of Tashkent</strong> – 1 time of the base calculation amount (<strong>330 thousand soums</strong>);</li> <li><strong>in other regions </strong> – 0.5 times of the base calculation amount <strong>(165 thousand soums</strong>) is reimbursed by the state.</li> </ul> <p>That is, for example, a student in Tashkent if he lives in an apartment together with his fellow students for 600,000 soums, then 330,000 soums will be reimbursed by the state.</p> <p>Also, in order to be reimbursed for the rent in September and October, it is not necessary to show any rental contract, even if there is no contract, student accommodation in HEIs will be covered now. <strong>distributed through a special online system</strong> and bureaucracy and the human factor are reduced to a minimum.</p> <p>The new changes include other good news regarding the provision of hostels to students. In this regard, we are planning to organize a voice chat with the relevant officials. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/6/6-sinf-nemis-tili" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p></strong>
