                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>That is why now it is better to hold exams in large-capacity buildings in order to be transparent and fair.</strong><br/><strong>If the same knowledge was given everywhere, the certificates would also be the same.</strong><br/><strong>-Even though the test system is temporary a lot of selection is done through the test.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><em>At the moment, admission to the bachelor's degree in higher education institutions is ongoing. For applicants, every update of the State Test Center, the authorized organization conducting the exam, is important. For this reason, Kun.uz and </em><em>Xpress.uz</em><em> publications jointly organized an interview with Majid Karimov, director of the State Test Center. What is the reason for this?</em></p> <p>—The main reason is related to the pandemic. I'm thinking of places to go because I'm old. It's true, even then I go to many places, but all with graphics.</p> <p><strong>- Recently, various organizations are transferring the authority of conducting exams to the State Testing Center, and the phrase "it's better that DTM conducts the test to be fair" is being used a lot. In your opinion, can this be evaluated as confidence in the test system?</strong></p> <p>—Not only organizations, but also people's opinion about the test has changed, even a little confidence has been formed. We are very happy about it. Since the opening began in the second half of 2017, there is still a lot of work to be done.</p> <p>Our current goal is to introduce a system of conducting exams throughout the year, not only on certain days in the summer, but at times convenient for the children. Qualifying is required due to the small number of HEIs and admission quotas. That is why now it is recommended to conduct the exams in large capacity buildings in order to make them transparent and fair. In 2016 and earlier, the tests were held in more than 2,000 buildings.</p> <p><strong>—What do you think DTM is gaining people's trust at the expense of?</strong></p> <p>—Firstly, the tests began to be held in large-capacity buildings.</p> <p>Secondly, the exams began to be broadcast online. Previously, this was not possible due to the large number of buildings and Internet problems. Now it is possible to monitor the voluntary group through a camera during the voluntary time.</p> <p>In addition, the conditions created for the applicant during the exam have also improved. Refrigeration equipment is working, it is enough for the test-takers to come only with proof of identity. Is there even a 1 percent chance of that?</p> <p>—No. Now it is done in such a way that the door of the test building will not open even for me. Only those with special permission can enter this building.</p> <figure class="image alignnone"><img alt="" src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/7/IhBOQ3I2XvwCC5DYOqIISYzQ0rhDhEiE.jpg"/> <figcaption class="">Director of the State Test Center Majid Karimov</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>—As admission quotas continue to be set, Even if the state test center makes the questions easy or difficult, the person assigned to the designated place will still be accepted. What do you think should be done to eliminate this situation?</strong></p> <p>-At first, we talked a lot about this problem with the president, we discussed what will happen in the future. Many people think that it is difficult to enroll in our country, but it is easy to graduate. I also worked in higher education. In fact, in our HEIs, they try to make students graduate as much as possible. Not so much abroad. In our case, someone uses an acquaintance, someone uses the excuse that the situation is difficult.</p> <p>As for the test, it is not correct to say that the questions are complicated. The questions are prepared by school teachers and the tests are conducted by experts. Questions are drawn from textbooks within the curriculum.</p> <p>One of the main problems with tests so far has been textbooks. Because the textbooks in specialized educational institutions and general education schools were different. Now Public Education is working on the unification of textbooks. It has been a very positive change, but it is a very big process: it can take 2-3 years.</p> <p>Another reason why the test is called difficult is related to the fact that different regions of the republic provide different knowledge. If the same education was given everywhere, the certificates would be the same. But, unfortunately, the composition of teachers and their knowledge are different. The education of school graduates will also be different.</p> <p>Now school graduates take the graduation exam and after 2 months they will take the entrance exams. A unification project has now been created to avoid repetition. If the project is fully developed and approved, DTM will receive graduation exams from schools from 2023. That is, DTM will take exams in all subjects based on the programs and textbooks provided by the Ministry of Public Education. This will also be included in the certificate and this grade can be counted in the entrance exam.</p> <p><strong>—About when will the plan to move to the year-round exam system by abandoning the exams that are held once a year in large pavilions be fully implemented, and the burden of DTM will be lightened?</strong></p> <p>—This is a very big deal. We are conducting more than 30 tests so far. Now it is decided that DTM will also conduct the master's degree and transfer exams. But I think that it is temporary for us to conduct the foreign language exam for the master's degree. The reason is that from next year, a foreign language certificate will be required from applicants for master's degrees. They are given tests from a year ago. For example, those who want to transfer their studies this year may have worked the DTM tests last year and failed the exam. According to the studies of the relevant organizations, those who transfer their studies are mainly candidates for areas that require a great deal of knowledge, such as medicine and jurisprudence. Therefore, the score they get should not be less than the passing score of the previous year. They are given another offer: the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education can also provide an opportunity to study on a differentiated fee-contract. Most of the test buildings are empty during the summer. Special buildings with a large capacity are currently being built in the regions. If they are two, it will be possible to take an exam from 1000 people in one shift and 2000 people in one day. and the applicant can take the exam at any time, even before completing the 11th grade. If he wants, he can take part in the entrance exam with that score, and if he doesn't want, he can take the exam after another month or two.</p> <p>It takes a long 3 years. If unification and national certificate exams follow, the number of exam takers will decrease sharply in the summer. This can lead to the continuation of corruption. In this case, what do you think should be done to completely eliminate corruption?</p> <p>—Actually, higher education institutions train those entering the master's degree. But why does the Higher Education Institution not accept students independently, even if it educates them. We discuss this a lot. But for now, the fight against corruption continues, and the system of independence of higher education institutions is being introduced. The test is used until all of these are tracked. Therefore, I think that the test is temporary.</p> <p>I cannot say that the test is the best way to determine the knowledge of each evaluator. Currently, the test is a tool to sort out students in a short period of time due to the large number of students we have. But if the situation is good, higher education institutions themselves will be able to select the applicants based on the grades of the students' certificates.</p> <p><strong>-At the moment, even though the test system is temporary, a lot of selection is done through the test. And the test is monopolized. Let's imagine that if a critical device of DTM fails or there is a problem in the organization, the qualifiers can come to a complete halt. That is why it is not possible to divide the authority between different organizations? Let's say, by giving opportunities to private organizations?</strong></p> <p><img alt="" src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/7/5L3eI77rMWVpSJf_UtnJ1XHwQzdZzFcn.jpg"/></p> <p>—This is true, but every business should have an owner. For example, if we are given an assignment, we must complete it. If the work is divided between one or two organizations, some problems may arise.</p> <p>But it is not right to assign all the work to a single organization. This can lead to quality degradation and errors. We are also not against private or foreign organizations taking the test. Only a license and approval from the State Commission is required. I don't think there is any opposition to this.</p> <p>Now many people are protesting why the block of compulsory subjects was introduced. These objections are also appearing in those who transfer to the areas where special talent is required. But do they also have a school graduation certificate, a document confirming that they have graduated from an academic lyceum? Yes, they do. The questions that appear in the compulsory block are also in the programs they studied. These questions were tested on students of 9th grade and students worked out these questions in a short period of time. Applicants are given 1.5 hours for the compulsory block.</p> <p>I think that those who apply for fields requiring special talent should also be able to write an application in a literate manner, and show that they know the history of Uzbekistan well when they go abroad. They should be interested in other subjects and improve their knowledge not only in the 2 blocks of the specialty. And you admitted that the questions were actually DTM's, a task force was said to have been set up to look at how they were disseminated. People are also expressing their opinions that they have got rid of the corruption in the test and have been caught in the national test system. Can you tell me exactly how the questions are distributed now?</p> <p>—When we compared the test materials from Biology, it was found that the questions were in the same sequence as ours. However, our questions are prepared and converted to pdf before printing. If our version had spread, there would be no errors in the test materials. In addition, drawings and pictures were not included in the questions. This shows that the questions did not originate from DTM.</p> <p>DTM is not the only participant in the process. Questions are drawn up, printed and bagged. Everyone who does these things is under control. Before the information about the distribution of questions of the national test system was leaked to the media, we received signals and the investigation began. The possibility of the tests leaving the DTM has been investigated, the cameras have been examined.</p> <p>We have now contacted the relevant authorities to determine how the test materials were distributed. It is also important for us to find out how the test is distributed, because we have a big test ahead of us. We'll have to think about it.</p> <p>We also suspect that the tests may have been moved while on the route. But the questions were not copied, only the information was taken. This is just my guess. The situation is currently being investigated and an appropriate legal assessment will be made.</p> <p>We have time now. Reason questions should be checked in 20 working days. Now the answers of the test takers are being checked. After checking, it is studied and analyzed according to 2 different methods. Even after the results of the test, we will study them and show them to the State Commission, and the conclusions of the law-enforcement bodies will be taken, and then the results will be announced.
