                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>For applicants who did not score less than the minimum score (56.7 points this year), but did not reach the admission quota by more than 4.05 points, the amount of the super-contract will be determined in several times of the base contract, depending on their direction.</strong><br/><strong>That is, if the applicant has 56.7 points who scored a lot, but did not reach the passing score by more than 4.05 points, then he had the opportunity to become a student by paying the same amount of money. is given.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>At the moment, applicants who are students ask "How do we get into the dormitory?" ,"Can I make a super-contract for another direction?", and for those who cannot become a student, "how much will the super-contract cost?" questions are appearing. Answers to similar questions have been collected.</h4> <p><strong>It is necessary to contact the Higher Education Institution</strong></p> <p>The most appropriate option is for students to find and follow the official pages of the Higher Education Institution they have applied for. The latest news about each OTM is given on their official pages.</p> <p>In addition, it is useful for applicants who plan to become a student on the basis of a super-contract to follow the news about OTM.</p> <p><strong>How do first-year students settle in a dormitory?</strong></p> <p>The first thing that students who have been admitted to the university are confused about is finding accommodation before the start of studies. According to the information of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, online applications for dormitories from first-year students will soon be accepted.</p> <p>Students can submit an electronic application for accommodation in the student accommodation of state higher education institutions through the State Services Center or the Unified interactive state services portal - my.gov.uz. Even if there is no contract for the 1st courses, the rent for the months of September-October will be paid.</p> <p>In this case, 330,000 soums will be paid for students studying in Tashkent, and 165,000 soums for students studying in the regions. </p> <p><strong>What is the issue of the super-contract?</strong></p> <p>If the applicant's score falls short of the points in the admission quota, he will pay less, on the contrary, if it is not enough, he will pay more.</p> <p>According to the current law, the points he has collected are up to the limit of admission quotas under the approved payment contract:</p> <ul> <li>Up to 1 point for applicants who do not reach 1.5 points;</li> <li>for those who do not reach 1.1 to 2 points - 2.0 times;</li> <li>for those who do not reach 2.1 to 3 points - 2.5 times;</li> <li>for those who do not reach 3.1 to 4 points - can study by paying 3.0 times.</li> </ul> <p>Minimum points (56.7 points this year), but did not reach the admission quota by more than 4.05 points, the amount of the super-contract is determined depending on their direction in several times of the basic contract. 25 times of the basic contract (220.7 million soums).</p> <p>That is, if the applicant scored more than 56.7 points, but fell short of the passing score by more than 4.05 points, then he had the opportunity to become a student by paying this amount of money.</p> <p>If the applicant could not even score the minimum score if there is, then he will be given the right to become a student by paying 2 times of the highest contract amount set for his field. For example, if the amount of the super-contract for the jurisprudence course is set at 220.7 million soums, those who scored less than the minimum score can use the opportunity to study by paying twice as much. Applicants who are interested in this question will have to wait a little longer.</p> <p><strong>Is it possible to replace one applicant with another?</strong></p> <p>The places of applicants who were accepted as students within the quota, but do not want to study, will remain empty. According to the information obtained from the press service of the Knowledge Assessment Agency, those who do not study, but who passed the post-test after the applicant was accepted as a student, will not be promoted. If the applicants below the admission line want to become a student, they will have to choose the super-contract option.</p> <p><strong>Last year, it was possible to "super" the first course</strong></p> <p>According to the decision of the State Admission Commission in 2022, the applicant could not enter the first course of his choice, but could enter the 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th courses. if he enrolled in one, he was allowed to study in the super-contract in his first chosen field of his choice.</p> <p>This exception does not apply to the 2nd, 3rd or 4th field. That is, an applicant who has entered the fifth field of study will not be able to make a super-contract by choosing the second or fourth field, but will be able to do it only in the first field. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ozbekistonlik-legioner-futbolchilarga-maktab-va-klub-ochish-uchun-yer-ajratiladi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
