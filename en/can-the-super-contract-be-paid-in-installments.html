                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Is it possible to pay the super-contract in installments?</strong><br/><strong>In the last academic year, it was possible for those paying the super-contract to pay in two installments throughout the year or even on the basis of monthly payments. cannot be allocated, it can be obtained only through commercial banks.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Is it possible to pay the super-contract in installments?</h2> <p>In the last academic year, it was possible for the payers of the super-contract <strong>to be paid in two installments during the year</strong> or even <strong>on the basis of monthly payments</strong>. Therefore, the same procedure is expected to continue in the 2024/2025 academic year. This will help ease the financial burden for students and their families.</p> <h3>Are super-contract education loans available?</h3> <p>According to current legislation, <strong>super-contract education loans are not available</strong>. This means that preferential educational loans provided by the state are given only to students studying on the basis of a regular contract. However, some commercial banks may offer their own loan products under market conditions. This means that the interest rates and terms are likely to be high.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Although there is an option to pay the super-contract in installments, this procedure is approved each year based on a separate decision. Education loan is not officially allocated for super-contract, it can be obtained only through commercial banks. Therefore, applicants and students are advised to make a proper financial plan in advance. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qizlar-olimpiadasi-saralash-10-11-noyabrda" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p>
