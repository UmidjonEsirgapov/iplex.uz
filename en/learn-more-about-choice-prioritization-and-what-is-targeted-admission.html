                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Quotas are distributed in the section of directions, and places in the section of directions are distributed in the section of regions.</strong><br/><strong>For example, if the applicant for the field of Treatment of Tashkent Medical University is allocated 2 places in the region where he lives, he will be selected for both these 2 places and the allocated general quota. participates.</strong><br/><strong>With targeted admission, it is possible to get a grant even with a lower score. But 2 things should be taken into account: A student enrolled with targeted admission is not allowed to "perevod"; After graduation, they are obliged to work in their own region for 5 years.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>One of the most interesting questions for our applicants, we will focus on what is the selection priority and targeted admission. also determines the priority.</p> <p>There are <strong>2 selection priorities</strong>, and the applicant chooses as a priority:</p> <ol> <li><strong>If he chooses "State grant"</strong> - in all the educational fields he chooses, first a state grant, then on the basis of a payment contract;</li> <li><strong>If he chooses "Educational field"</strong> - every education participates in a series of selections based on a state grant and payment contract.</li> </ol> <p>The picture below shows their exact mechanism.</p> <p><img class="wp-image-3016" src="https://tavsiyars.uz/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Tanlov-ustuvorligini-nima-1024x694.jpg"/></p> <p>The selection is chosen by the applicant <strong>is carried out on the basis of the priority chosen by him according to the strict sequence of educational directions</strong>. Applicants are asked to be careful when setting priorities.</p> <h2>What is targeted admission?</h2> <p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of applying for a grant with targeted admission?</p> <p>If you want to use targeted admission, then be sure to read this post.</p> <p>Who can participate in targeted admission? After the quota is approved, the target admission places are divided by regions. In order to use the targeted admission quota allocated to one region, an applicant who permanently lives in that region (has a residence permit) uses targeted admission.</p> <p>The applicant must also have a document, i.e., a certificate of completion of general secondary or secondary education.</p> <p>How are targeted admission quotas distributed? and the seats in the section are distributed in the section of the regions. For example, areas such as health care and public education are separated.</p> <p>Will those who do not score enough points in targeted admission drop out of school?</p> <p>If the applicant who participated in the targeted admission contest scores the required points, he will become a student on the basis of a grant. But if he does not pass, he will participate in the general competition together with other applicants. If he gets the score, he will definitely be a student.</p> <p>How is targeted admission selected when applying for studies?</p> <p>If an applicant who is applying online for admission to OTM chooses targeted admission, he will participate in both targeted and general selection. For example, if an applicant to the field of Treatment of Tashkent Medical University is allocated 2 places in the area where he lives, he will participate in the competition for these 2 places and for the allocated general quota. class="iframe-wrapper"&gt;Later, after graduation, he is obliged to work in his own territory for 5 years. <iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ROna4WPnDc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/sharoit-yoqmi-ozingiz-yaratib-muvaffaqiyatga-erishing" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in education..
