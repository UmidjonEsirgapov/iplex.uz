                Important news about higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Let's take a look at the guide to overcoming laziness: Create a discipline for yourself and stick to it.</strong><br/><strong>Studying without breaks can make you bored. (for example, being a student) break it into small pieces (for example, reading a few pages of a book every day).  <p><strong>Let's take a look at the guide to overcoming laziness:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Make a discipline for yourself and stick to it. The most important thing is to be able to achieve discipline.</li> <li>Eliminate things that distract you when you are studying.</li> <li>Make your schedule, so that you are always clear about what you will do at what time.</li> <li>Strictly adhere to the time allotted for studying every day.</li> <li>Take breaks. For example, study for 40 minutes and listen to music for 5 minutes or go outside. Studying without breaks can make you bored.</li> <li>Set achievable goals. If you have a big goal (like becoming a student), break it down into small chunks (like reading a few pages a day). Then there will be no demotivation.</li> <li>Ask for help when needed. No matter who it is.</li> <li>Reward yourself when you accomplish a goal.</li> <li>Start with easier, lighter tasks. For example, I will memorize 10 new words in one day. If you set a big goal of memorizing 100 new words in one day, if you can't achieve it, demotivation will occur. This ensures that you will not be distracted during the preparation of the lesson.</li> <li>Choose a suitable place for the lesson. Your seat must be comfortable in every way.</li> <li>Make a plan and always monitor the sequence of its implementation.</li> <li>Think about how you will feel after achieving your goal. For example, you became a student on the basis of a grant. What kind of happiness do you feel? Think about this often during lesson preparation, it's encouraging.</li> <li>Try different teaching techniques. Alone, with a partner, in the heart of nature, in the form of questions and answers, etc.</li> </ul> <p>⚠️ Conclusion: any difficult task becomes easy when properly organized. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/2/2-sinf-nemis-tili" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.</strong>
