He criticized that, although necessary funds have been allocated to the education system, the Ministry is not doing enough effective work. Kadyrov noted that there are no visible changes in kindergartens and schools.</p> <p>As part of criticism, Alisher Kadyrov cited as an example the news that one of the teachers involved in hard labor in Andijan had a broken arm.
