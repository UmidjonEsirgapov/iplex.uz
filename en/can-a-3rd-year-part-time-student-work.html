                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Hello, my question is: Can a psychology faculty student studying part-time for the 3rd year work as a deputy director of economic affairs in the school? thanks in advance for the answer!</strong><br/><strong>Because these positions do not require higher education.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Hello, my question is this: can a student of the faculty of psychology studying 3 courses by correspondence work in the school as a deputy director of economic affairs? In general, can a 1st-2nd-3rd year student studying by correspondence work in a school in positions such as personnel manager, clerk, thank you in advance for the answer!</p> <p>Excerpt from the appendix of the order of the Minister of Public Education No. 393 of December 7, 2019 "QUALIFICATIONS OF THE MAIN POSITIONS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION EMPLOYEES" A bachelor's degree is required to become a deputy director.</p> <p><strong>❌ So you cannot work in this position. </strong>But you can work as a personnel manager or laboratory assistant. Because these positions do not require higher education.</p> <p>Appendix 3 to the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers dated December 21, 2005 No. 275, paragraph 8 of the REGULATION "On the payment of wages for the work of public education employees", persons studying in the pedagogical directions of the day, evening, part-time forms of education of the higher educational institution Starting from the 3rd year, they can be hired as the main job in general education institutions to carry out pedagogic work without interfering with their studies, and a basic tariff rate is set for them, similar to the basic tariff rate of an employee in a relevant position with secondary special, professional education.</p> <p></p> <p>Legal service — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/never-give-up" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: based on information from the oliygoh.uz site prepared.
