                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Because the current year's quotas approved by the Presidential Decree have several differences from the previous ones: First, the quotas were announced not in the section of HEIs, but in the section of the directions; Secondly, the quotas were announced only for the state grant, not for the payment contract; Thirdly, quotas were announced only for full-time education, not for part-time, evening and distance education.</strong><br/><strong>It is expected that the State Admission Commission will approve the following for the 2024/2025 academic year: general admission parameters (in terms of universities, forms of education, and languages); additional admission options (for eligible applicants); target admission quotas and the distribution of these quotas among districts (cities); the minimum passing score for admission; the share of the state grant quota compared to the general admission parameter.</strong><br/><strong>"This year, 115 grant quotas have been allocated for the field of jurisprudence.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>It is natural that many people have questions about the announced quotas for the new academic year. Because the current year's quotas approved by the President's decree have several differences from the previous ones:</p> <ul> <li>Firstly, the quotas were announced not in the section of HEIs, but in the section of the courses;</li> <li>Secondly, the quotas were announced only for the state grant, not for the payment contract;</li> <li>Thirdly, the quotas were announced only for the full-time form of education. <strong>no for outside, evening and remote.</strong></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Legal blogger Khushnudbek Khudoiberdiyev gave some explanations about the new system.</p> <p><strong>When and by whom will the detailed quotas be announced?</strong></p> <p>Detailed quotas will be announced by the State Admissions Commission. Usually it takes about 1 more week. That is, after the President approves the general quota, we will have to wait for the detailed quotas again.</p> <p><strong>What will the State Admission Commission approve?</strong></p> <p>We should wait for the State Admission Commission to approve the following for the 2024/2025 academic year:</p> <ul> <li>general admission parameters (in terms of universities, forms of education and languages);</li> <li>additional admission parameters (for privileged applicants);</li> <li>targeted admission quotas and the distribution of these quotas in the section of districts (cities);</li> <li>the minimum passing score for admission;</li> <li>the share of the state grant quota compared to the general admission parameter.</li> </ul> <p><strong>If the grant quota is in the section of directions, what is it? will be distributed?</strong></p> <p>Starting this year, state grants will not be given to universities, but will be allocated to the direction. For example, there will be no specific grant quota for the Tashkent State Law University, it will receive 50, 100, it is not said. Perhaps a general grant quota will be allocated for the field of jurisprudence.</p> <p>In this case, among the applicants who applied to the field of jurisprudence in all universities of the republic, those who scored the highest points within the quota, regardless of which university they applied to, will receive a grant. This means that some universities may no longer have a single student who received a grant. For example, TDU, UzMU, QDU, SamDU and NamDU have jurisprudence. All applicants to the jurisprudence department of these 5 universities will be evaluated in order of points, and grants will be awarded to 115 applicants with the highest scores. Then, for example, 50 grants to TDY, 25 grants to UzMU, 20 grants to QSU, etc. It may be true.</p> <p>In other words, instead of saying that the state will give a grant to such and such a university, it is saying that it will give a grant to intelligent applicants who have applied to a certain course and received high marks. This means that entering a contract at a university with 160 points and getting a grant for the same course at another university with 100 points will disappear.</p> <p>There will be only one exception. A limit is set to prevent one university from taking the entire quota of the state grant. For example, all 115 quotas can fall under TDYU. At this time, for example, a 50 percent limit is imposed. That is, TDU will be able to receive only half of 115 quotas, i.e. 57 grant quotas. It is still necessary to wait for the approval of quotas in the fields of universities, payment contracts, forms of education and languages. It is not known how long we will have to wait, it depends on the State Admissions Commission chaired by the Prime Minister",</p>  <p>the post says. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/yapon-talim-tizimi-oquvchilar-uchun-intizomiy-qoidalar-va-talablar" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
