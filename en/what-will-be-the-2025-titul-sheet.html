                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Important guide to filling in the answer sheet correctly For applicants preparing for tests, it is extremely important to fill in the answer sheet correctly. It is considered wrong.</strong><br/><strong>Every small mistake can lose a big opportunity.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Important guide to fill the answer sheet correctly</h2> <p>Filling the answer sheet correctly is extremely important for the applicants who are preparing for the tests. Getting a high score on the test depends not only on knowledge, but also on a careful approach to the technique. Below we provide detailed information on how to fill out the answer sheet correctly.</p> <h3>❌ The most common mistakes</h3> <h4>1. Paint outside the circle</h4> <p>The painted circle should be clean and clear. Going beyond the edge of the circle is considered an error by the scanner.</p> <h4>2. Not completely painting the inside of the circle</h4> <p>Just a light drawing or not completely painting is also considered wrong. It is required to paint the inside of the circle in full, clear and uniform dark color.</p> <h4>3. Fixing a mistake by "punching" it</h4> <p>Many people try to fix a wrong character by "punching" it, but the scanner can't read the character. Puncturing the answer sheet is strictly prohibited.</p> <h4>4. Marking multiple answers at the same time</h4> <p>If you mark two or more circles for one test question, this answer is also considered an error. Mark only one answer for each question.</p> <h4>5. Losing a title due to carelessness</h4> <p>Every technical error can deprive you of a high score and even a title. So, caution is the key to success.</p> <h2>Download the PDF file and start practicing!</h2> <p>📥 Download Answer Sheet (PDF)</p> <p>Print the downloaded file and practice how to fill it now.
