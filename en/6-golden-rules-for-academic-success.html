                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Prayer of the teachers: Knowledge is not acquired, it is transmitted.</strong><br/><strong>Regular and appropriate organization of sleep leads to success in learning.</strong><br/><strong>Heaviness in the morning leads to laziness.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>In learning achieving success requires not only acquiring knowledge, but also mastering certain values. Below are 6 important rules for students of knowledge:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Prayer of parents:</strong>Prayer of parents is very important in the way of learning. Their prayer brings blessings to science and ensures perfection. Don't forget to open your hands in prayer every morning and wish your parents good intentions. The love and experience of teachers play a big role in learning. Treat your teachers with respect and their experience will be passed on to you.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Attitude:</strong>Attitude is important in learning. Being arrogant slows down the learning process. Apply what you learn with kindness and your knowledge will be useful.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sleep:</strong>Avoid sleep while studying. Being clean and walking cleanly will help you learn the lessons. A regular and appropriate arrangement of sleep leads to success in learning.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Not skipping classes:</strong>Skiping today's lesson makes tomorrow's lesson difficult. Tomorrow's heaviness will lead to sluggishness. Make it a habit to study on time every day.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Time:</strong>The value of time is extremely high. He never returns, only leaves. Therefore, plan and use your time effectively. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/abituriyentlar-uchun-mutaxassislik-fanlarida-savollar-qanday-taqsimlanadi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> </li> </ol> <br/><br/>How do you feel about this news?
