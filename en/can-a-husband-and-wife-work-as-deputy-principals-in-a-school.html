                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Question: Can a husband and wife work in the same school as a deputy director of economic affairs and a deputy director of academic affairs? If not.</strong><br/><strong>That is, teachers and librarians in pedagogic positions are close relatives and can work in the same school.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Question: <strong>Can a husband and wife work in the same school as a deputy director for economic affairs and a deputy director for educational affairs?</strong></p> <p><strong>Answer: Mutually close relatives work in the organization is legal only on the condition that they are not directly subordinated or under the control of each other. This situation is defined in <strong>Article 121</strong> of the Labor Code.</strong></p> <p><strong>Article 121</strong>, close relatives (parents, brothers, sisters, spouses, etc.) can work in the same organization, if their duties do not create a requirement of <strong>direct subordination</strong> or <strong>supervision</strong> to each other.</p> <p><strong>As an exception</strong> in accordance with the Cabinet of Ministers <strong>Decision No. 133 dated March 11, 1997</strong>, these rules do not apply to pedagogic staff, teachers, librarians and librarians. That is, teachers and librarians in pedagogic positions are close relatives and can work in the same school.</p> <h3><strong>Legal conclusion:</strong></h3> <p>If a husband and wife work as deputy principals in a school, this situation does not contradict the requirements of the <strong>Labor Code</strong>. Because both of them are managers and <strong>do not directly report to each other</strong>. Therefore, it is legal for them to work in the same school as a substitute for economic affairs and academic affairs. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/2025-yilgi-qabuldagi-asosiy-yangiliklar" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
