                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Kushnudbek Khudoyberdiyev was given by some applicants "Does admission to the master's degree depend on the diploma score or the certificate level?" contacted the officials of the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education and gave the following answer to the question.</strong><br/><strong>So, the explanation of the Ministry was as follows: first of all, there will be a selection based on the level of the language certificate specified in the law according to the mastery score in the diploma; after that, if there are free places in the quota, applicants with a certificate below the specified level will be sorted and accepted again according to the diploma score.</strong><br/><strong>As an example, let's say that the following 4 applicants applied to the non-philology course: Ali - diploma score 82, certificate C1; Nigora - 87, B2; Vali - 80, B1; Sabohat - 88, A2.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>The Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation has decided to continue the winter admission to the master's degree from December 20 to January 10. <strong>exceptionally</strong> language proficiency certificate level was not requested. That is, regardless of the certificate level, one can be admitted to the master's degree program, but in the future, he must obtain the required degree before graduation, otherwise, the master's degree will not be awarded. Actually, the level required by the law: ➖ <strong>for philological fields - C1;</strong><strong>➖ for all other fields - B2.</strong></p> <p>Kushnudbek Khudoyberdiyev was given by some applicants "Does admission to the master's degree depend on the diploma score or the certificate level?" The Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education responded as follows.</p> <p> applicants will be sorted and accepted according to their diploma scores.  <p><strong>For example, let's say that the following 4 applicants applied to the non-philology course:</strong></p> <p>Ali - diploma score 82, certificate C1; Nigora - 87, B2; Vali - 80, B1; Sabohat - 88, A2.</p> <p><strong>In this case, the final result is as follows. will be:</strong></p> <p>1. Nigora — 87, B2;2. Ali — 82, C1.</p> <p><strong>If there is an additional place in the quota, then holders of certificates below the required B2 level will be selected:</strong></p> <p>3. Sabahat — 88, A2;4. Vali — 80, B1.</p> <p>As you can see, the selection is based on the diploma score, not the certificate level. But those who have the certification level required by law are recommended first. If there is more space in the quota, holders of certificates of a lower level than the required level will be allowed as an exception.</p> <p> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/xalqaro-ilmiy-maqolalar-tanlovi-noutbuk-yutib-olish-imkoniyati" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p></p>
