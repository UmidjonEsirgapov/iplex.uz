                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Now the practice of distributing the state grant in the section of higher education institutions will be canceled, and the procedure for approval in the form of full-time education will be introduced for bachelor's education and master's specialties.</strong><br/><strong>What does this mean?</strong><br/><strong>K. Khudoyberdiyev explained now state grants are not given for such and such a university, but allocated for a field.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Now the practice of distributing state grants in the section of HEIs will be abolished, and the procedure for approval in the form of full-time education will be introduced for bachelor's education fields and master's specialties. is not given, but allocated for direction. For example, Tashkent State University of Law will not have a specific grant place, but a general grant quota will be allocated for the direction of jurisprudence.</p> <h3>Advantages of the new system</h3> <p><strong>Quota distribution:</strong></p> <ul> <li>State grants will be allocated by direction, therefore among the applicants who applied to the direction of jurisprudence in all HEIs in the republic, the highest score within the quota collected will be included in the grant, regardless of which higher education institution it is submitted to.</li> <li>This means that some higher education institutions may no longer have any students enrolled in the grant.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p> <ul> <li>According to the plan, a 50% limit will be set for higher education institutions in order to prevent the entire quota of the state grant from being taken away by one higher education institution.</li> </ul> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>According to the new system, state grants will be allocated to departments, not universities. This system provides more opportunities to applicants and serves to distribute quotas fairly. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oliygoh/toshkent-davlat-agrar-universiteti" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
