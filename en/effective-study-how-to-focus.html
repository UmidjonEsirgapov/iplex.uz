Below are 5 important recommendations for concentration.</p> <h4>1. Choose a quiet place free of distractions</h4> <p>Start studying in a quiet environment <strong>away from distractions</strong> to focus. Distracting sounds and external factors can distract and reduce efficiency, so study in a quiet and peaceful place.</p> <h4>2. Take short breaks</h4> <p>Prolonged reading can tire the brain. So take <strong>short breaks</strong> and rest. For example, take a 5-10 minute break every 45 minutes. This allows the brain to rest and focus.</p> <h4>3. Turn off your phone and notifications</h4> <p>It's important to <strong>turn off notifications on your phone or computer</strong> while you study. Notifications from various social networks can be distracting and an obstacle to studying. Leave the phone aside and devote yourself only to the lesson.</p> <h4>4. Hydrate your body</h4> <p>Hydrating your body is important for brain performance. Keep a water bottle with you and drink regularly to reduce any fatigue.</p> <h4>5. Review and Summarize What You've Learned</h4> <p>Make <strong>summaries</strong> of the material learned or explain them to others to reinforce memory and focus. It will not only strengthen your knowledge, but also help you to understand the topic more deeply. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/6/6-sinf-fizika" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p>
