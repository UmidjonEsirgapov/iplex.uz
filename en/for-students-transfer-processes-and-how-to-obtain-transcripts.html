                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Students who want to transfer their studies, whether they are studying abroad or studying in public or private universities in our country, this post applies to all categories.</strong><br/><strong>Admission processes for transferring studies from July 15 </strong><br/><strong>The main document required from you is a transcript.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Students who want to transfer their studies, whether they are studying abroad or studying in public or private universities in our country, this post applies to all categories.</p> <p><strong>From July 15, admission processes for transferring studies will begin.</strong> Request from you The main document is a <strong>transcript</strong>. If you cannot complete the semester you are studying at the moment, or if there is debt from subjects, or even if the semester ends later, this does not have any effect on transferring studies.</p> <p><strong>According to the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 393 adopted in 2017</strong>, in order to transfer a student's studies, "there should be no debt from the first semester of the first year". This means that the outstanding balance of the remaining semesters does not matter. That is, regardless of the year you are in, you can transfer your studies even if you owe money from the last semester. This is clearly stated in the legislation.</p> <p><strong>Illegal situations:</strong> It is absolutely illegal for the officials of some private or public universities not to give you a transcript under the pretext that you have a debt for subjects in the last semester saying "we cannot give you a transcript, we don't give it, you can't do it."</p> <p><strong>Additional measures:</strong></p> <ul> <li>If you have if such a situation is observed, demand a written answer from that person that he will not provide the transcript. Learn to demand your rights.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Situations in private universities:</strong> This situation is mainly observed in private universities. They explain this with their internal procedure. Keep in mind that any domestic regulation cannot prevail over the higher legal acts, but instead is implemented in the case based on those laws. Demands by private HEIs not to release transcripts are also completely <strong>illegal</strong>. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qishloq-sharoitida-oqishga-tayyorlanayotgan-abituriyentlar" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>Stay tuned for more news in education.
