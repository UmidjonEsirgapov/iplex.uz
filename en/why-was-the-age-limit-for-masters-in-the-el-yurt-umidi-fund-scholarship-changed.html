                Today's most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>What were the old and new age limits?</strong><br/><strong>According to the new regulation: Master's degree: those under 22 and over 40 cannot participate.</strong><br/><strong>Why can't 21-year-olds apply?</strong><br/><hr/> <h1>El-Yurt Umid Scholarship: Why has the age limit for masters been changed?</h1> <p>Based on the new Regulation of the El-Yurt Umid Foundation dated May 5, 2025, the age limit for the scholarship for masters has changed. In previous years, those between the ages of 20-45 could apply, but now these limits have been narrowed to the age range of 22-40.</p> <p>We will look at the details of this change and the answers to the questions below.</p> <h2>What were the previous and new age limits?</h2> <h3>According to the previous Regulation:</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Master's degree:</strong> Those under the age of 20 and over 45 could not participate.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>According to the new regulation:</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Master's degree:</strong> Those under the age of 22 and over the age of 40 could not participate.</p> </li> </ul> <p>That is, the minimum age was 20. now it has increased to 22 years. The maximum age has been reduced from 45 to 40 years.</p> <h2>Why are 21-year-olds unable to apply?</h2> <p>The main reasons behind this decision have not yet been disclosed in open sources. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The minimum age limit may have been increased in order to have sufficient knowledge, experience and maturity for the Master's degree.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is possible that the aim is to approximate the work experience requirement and to comply with international standards.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is unlikely that the age group will be narrowed in order to allocate resources in a targeted and efficient way. not.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>What advice can be given to 21-year-olds?</h2> <p>For now, young people who cannot apply because they are 21 years old can do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Enhance qualifications, engage in scientific research for a year.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gain practice or work experience.</p> </li> <li> <p>IELTS, Improving language and proficiency certificates such as GRE.</p> </li> <li> <p>Preparing to re-apply next year.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Opportunities do not close with increasing age, on the contrary, opportunities expand by gaining experience.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>El-Yurt Umidi Foundation's decision to change the age limits for the master's degree has raised questions among many young people. It is not yet clear why exactly those under the age of 22 cannot apply and what are the reasons behind this decision. However, for 21-year-olds, this time can be taken as an opportunity to work on yourself, gain knowledge and experience. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/5" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>How do you look at this news?
