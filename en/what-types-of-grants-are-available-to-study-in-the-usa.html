                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Such grants are awarded to international students who are citizens of developing countries.</strong><br/><strong>These criteria are determined by the university itself, for example, a university may award grants to candidates with the highest scores applying to study in a certain field.</strong><br/><strong>for </strong><br/><hr/> <p>There are 6 main types of grants for studying at US universities. Depending on the situation, these can be provided in the form of a full or partial grant.</p> <p><strong>We will provide brief information about them below.</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Merit scholarships. Such grants are awarded based on the student's performance and achievements.</strong></p> <p>For example, such grants: - for excellent grades and/or high scores on the SAT/ACT exam (Academic Scholarships); - for the student's contribution to society and participation in extracurricular activities in addition to excellent grades and exams (Average Academic Performance Scholarships); - for sports achievements (Sports Scholarships) possible.</p> <p><strong>2. Need-based scholarships. These grants are awarded to students who cannot afford to pay tuition fees and other study-related expenses.</strong></p> <p><strong>3. Country-based scholarships. Such grants are awarded to international students who are citizens of developing countries.</strong></p> <p><strong>4. University grants.</strong> Many US universities offer their own grants to international students who meet certain criteria.</p> <p>These criteria are determined by the university itself, for example, a university may award grants to candidates with the highest scores applying for studies in a particular field.</p> <p><strong>5. Grants funded by the private sector. </strong>Such grants are offered to international students by private companies, organizations, etc.</p> <p>But usually their requirements are relatively strict and they are often given to students belonging to a specific group (for example, women, citizens of developing countries, etc.).</p> <p><strong>6. Grants funded by the US government. Such grants are allocated by the US government to international students in order to globalize the education system. These grants are usually the most prestigious grants for studying in the USA (for example, the Fulbright grant for master's studies.</strong></p> <p><strong>How do I know what kind of grant is offered at which university?</strong></p> <p>For this, you go to the official website of the desired university and from there go to the section dedicated to financial aid and grants.</p> <p>You can find out what grants are available for international students in this section.</p> <p></p> <p>source — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/navoiy-va-fargonada-oqishga-kiritib-qoyishni-vada-qilgan-firibgarlar-ushlandi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
