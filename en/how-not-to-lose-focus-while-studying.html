But this leads to a decrease in the quality of mastering and loss of time. Better not to get distracted. </p> <p><strong>How? </strong></p> <p><strong>Find an atmosphere where you won't be distracted.</strong> Someone prepares a lesson better in a very quiet room, someone in a crowded library. </p> <p><strong>Put distractions away.</strong> If you are distracted by your phone, put it out of sight, not next to you while you are studying. </p> <p><strong>Make a plan. </strong>Determine how much you need to finish, how many minutes of break are useful for you. </p> <p><strong>Create an agenda</strong>. Regularly preparing lessons at the same time will help you not to be distracted by unnecessary things. </p> <p><strong>Don't forget to take breaks.</strong> Getting some fresh air or relaxing in some other way will help you to resume your studies in a better way. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/abituriyentlar-uchun-qurilayotgan-ming-kishilik-bino" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.
