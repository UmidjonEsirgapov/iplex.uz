                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>6 credits = 180 hours.</strong><br/><strong>60% of 180 hours (108 hours) – independent study.</strong><br/><strong>Student with academic debt will be dropped from the course.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Procedure for dropping a student with academic debt from the course (according to the credit-module system)</h2> <p>The attendance and knowledge level of students are strictly controlled in higher education institutions based on the <strong>credit-module system</strong>.

The procedure is explained step by step below.</p> <h3>📌 Credit and hours distribution</h3> <ul> <li> <p><strong>6 credits</strong> are allocated for 1 subject.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>1 credit</strong> is equal to <strong>30 hours</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>6 credits</strong> = <strong>180 hours</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>40%</strong> of 180 hours (72 hours) – classroom training.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>60%</strong> of 180 hours (108 hours) – independent education.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>📌 Attendance requirements</h3> <p>Student allocated for the audience <strong>72 If he misses ¼ of an hour</strong> (i.e. <strong>18 hours</strong>), he will not be included in the final inspection.</p> <h3>📌 Condition of academic debt</h3> <ul> <li> <p>A student who is not included in the final inspection is considered to be <strong>academic debtor</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A student with academic debt is <strong>dropped from the course</strong>.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>📌 The maximum period of stay at the higher education institution</h3> <p>A student of the bachelor's program can stay at the higher education institution for <strong>8 years</strong>.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Failure to follow the attendance standards in the credit-module system leads to academic debt. This may cause the student to be dropped from the course. Every student should consider attending classes and being ready for control exams as his main task. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/9/9-sinf-ingliz-tili" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
