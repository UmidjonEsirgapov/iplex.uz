                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Now the state grant is not given to one student for 4 years, but is redistributed every year among students with high grades. We have seen a lot of children from families whose circumstances are not right and who completely give up education.</strong><br/><strong>Here the issue is not only that one boy or girl will lose the knowledge that is worth more than the gold they have accumulated after 11 years of study, but also the work of the teachers who taught them will be wasted.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Now the state grant is not given to one student for 4 years, but every year it is redistributed among the students who got high grades.</p> <blockquote> <p>We have seen many children of families who applied the next year because of the fee agreement for 2-3 points, which previously did not have a significant difference of 0.75. It is not only the loss of valuable knowledge from the gold accumulated after 11 years of study, but also the loss of the work of the teachers who taught them.</p> <p>In the past, the state grant was continuously provided to one student at the undergraduate level, but now this grant is redistributed annually among the students who have received high marks in order to justify the grant, to regularly develop a sense of responsibility and study mastery, and to train competitive personnel. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/attestatsiya-shikoyat-10-kunda-qaror-10-kunda" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
