                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Applicants who have lost their passports for various reasons can easily take the test by getting a new ID card.</strong><br/><strong>Even if the passport series and number on the permit is different, this will not be a problem.</strong><br/><strong>Because most people take 1-2 days for the test. otherwise, he loses his document and misses the test without having time to get a new one.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Applicants who have lost their passport for various reasons can easily take the test by getting a new ID card. </p> <p>Even if the passport series and number on the permit are different, this will not be a problem. The main thing should be the identity document of the applicant. In addition, even if the series and number change when receiving a new passport, the JShSIR (identification) number of each person will not change, they will identify it through that. It's easy to get ID cards now, it only takes about 1 day, it's not as long as before.</p> <p><strong>Note: </strong>dear applicants, keep your passport or ID card safe. If it is not necessary, do not use it until the day of the test, let it stand in a clear place. Because many people lose their documents 1-2 days before the test and fail the test without having time to get a new one. Be careful. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/aqshda-oqiyotgan-ozbekistonlik-talabalar-soni-rekord-darajaga-yetdi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
