As a result, quotas were not filled.</p> <p>But this year, the number of applicants for master's degree has increased significantly due to the number of opportunities provided by the language certificate. As a result, the quotas were filled and the number of those who could not enter the master's degree increased.</p> <p>According to the current regulations, in order to give an additional opportunity to those who could not enter the master's degree within the quota, the possibility of admission to the master's degree was created based on the expenses of one student. In this decision, not a 3-4 times contract similar to a super-contract, but expenses for training 1 student are determined. This amount may be around <strong>15-20 million soums</strong>, but the exact amount may be less or more. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/chet-tili-sertifikati-qalbaki-ekani-aniqlansa-abituriyent-imtihondan-chetlashtiriladi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
