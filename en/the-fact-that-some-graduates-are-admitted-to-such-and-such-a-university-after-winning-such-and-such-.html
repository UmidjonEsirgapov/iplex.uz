                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Have you noticed that on the official channels of the Ministry of Education and the Agency of Specialized Educational Institutions, there are many messages about "such and such school student (graduate) was accepted to such and such university, such and such won a thousand dollar grant."</strong><br/><strong>A student with a clear goal usually appears. does not apply to tens or hundreds of universities.</strong><br/><strong>Therefore, "getting admission to such and such a university after winning such and such a thousand dollar grant" is not actually a "reform effect", it's just how the system of admission of foreign students of universities abroad works. There are many reports that a student (graduate) was accepted to such and such a university, and received such and such a thousand dollar grant. It is as if the ministry wants to show the results of reforms in the field. <strong>Such messages may sound nice, but there are aspects that should not be overlooked:</strong> <p><strong>1. Studying abroad (especially in English-language schools) is easy, especially for foreigners (non-citizens of their own country). The reason is that universities are interested in attracting more foreign students (for example, one of the evaluation criteria of international rankings is the share of foreign students). Therefore, in most cases, a certificate confirming the level of language proficiency (IELTS, TOEFL) is sufficient for admission. </strong></p> <p><strong>2. "So-and-so won a thousand dollar grant" does not mean that the university will give him that much money. </strong>Many universities offer various discounts to attract foreign students, for which the student must have good average grades in school, honors that show his activity in extracurricular activities. The so-called "grant of such and such a thousand dollars" usually means the amount of discounts offered to the student. Naturally, the student chooses only one of these universities and receives the discount from only one.</p> <p><strong>3. A student with a clear goal usually does not apply to tens or hundreds of universities. </strong>Universities abroad are academically independent, that is, the curriculum for one direction may differ from one another. A student with a clear goal will study the educational programs offered by universities, choose the one that suits their interests, and also pay attention to the reputation of the university and who teaches. Being "accepted" to dozens or hundreds of universities, in my opinion, shows the student's lack of a clear goal, not extraordinary talent. </p> <p><strong>4. Sometimes on the pages of the ministry, you can see a praise with the content "he was admitted to study before the deadline".</strong> No university accepts a student who has not graduated from school. If the student has a language certificate, he can submit his documents to the university online, and the university will usually send a "conditional acceptance" message, which means that the student can start studying after providing a certificate of graduation. </p> <blockquote> <p>Therefore, "getting admission to such and such a university after winning such and such a thousand dollar grant" is not really a "reform effect", it's just how foreign universities' admission system works.</p> </blockquote> <p>© Kamil Jalilov</p> <p> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oqishni-kochirish-uchun-otish-ballari" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
