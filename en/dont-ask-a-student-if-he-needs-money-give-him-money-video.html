                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The state does not stand by, it gives a scholarship of 517 thousand soums per month on average.</strong><br/><strong>How much does a student spend?</strong><br/><strong>Most of the students we questioned said that their monthly expenses are on average 1-1.5 million soums they said.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Tashkent is a city of bread and at the same time a city of students. You will see students hurrying at every step: to class, to work... It is not easy to earn money while studying. A student needs a lot of money for rent, travel expenses, food, etc. Thanks to the parents who sent their only child to a distant city to study. The state does not look at it, it gives a scholarship of 517,000 soums per month on average.</p> <p>So, is it easy to study and live in Tashkent? Is the state scholarship enough? What are the student expenses? Khabar.uz questioned young people.</p> <p><strong>- How much money does a student spend in a month?</strong></p> <p>Most of the students we questioned said that their monthly expenses reach 1-1.5 million soums on average. Students from the capital city spend around 200-500 thousand soums per month.</p> <p><strong>- Do you think that the one-month stipend given to students by the state is enough to cover their expenses?</strong></p> <p>When we asked our compatriots with this question, most of them answered that this money is not enough for a student's monthly rent. Because currently the average price of rental houses in the capital is 600-700 thousand soums per student.
