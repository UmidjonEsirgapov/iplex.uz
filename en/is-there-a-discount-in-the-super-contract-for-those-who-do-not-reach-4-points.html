                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>A 10 percent discount is given to applicants who paid the full amount of the differentiated (super) payment contract this year by October 15, 2023 (❗️this discount has nothing to do with ordinary contracts).</strong><br/><strong>But this discount, It applies to applicants who scored more than 56.7 points, but fell short of the entrance score by 4.05 points and dropped out.</strong><br/><strong>I would like to remind you that the scale of the super-contract up to 4 points is as follows: for applicants who do not reach the passing score by 1.05 points - 1.5 times the amount of the basic payment-contract; from 1.06 points to 2.05 points - 2 times; from 2.06 points to 3.05 points - 2.5 times; From 3.06 points to 4.05 points - 3 times.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>No discount is given to those with up to 4 points.</p> <p>A 10 percent discount is given to applicants who <strong>fully paid the value of the differentiated (super) payment contract this year</strong> by October 15, 2023 (❗️this discount is related to ordinary contracts (no).</p> <p>However, this discount applies to applicants who have scored more than 56.7 points, but are 4.05 points below the entrance score, and have dropped out. <strong>The discount is not applied to those with a scale of up to 4 points.</strong></p> <p>I would like to remind you that the scale of the super-contract up to 4 points is as follows:</p> <ul> <li>for applicants who do not reach the passing score of 1.05 points - 1.5 times the amount of the basic payment contract;</li> <li>from 1.06 points to 2.05 points - 2 </li> <li>From 2.06 points to 3.05 points - 2.5 times;</li> <li>From 3.06 points to 4.05 points - 3 times.</li> </ul> <p>Even though they pay 100%, there is no discount for those in this category. Therefore, you can pay 50% first and pay the rest in installments during the academic year.</p> <p>❗️NOTE: Many people are confused by the fact that it is written up to 4.05 points and think that it is 4.5 points. But not like that. There is a big difference between 4.05 (four hundred and zero five) and 4.5 (four and a half). Applicants with less than 4.1 (four to one) points on the entrance line will not fall into the above 4-point scale. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/4/4-sinf-ingliz-tili-daftar" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
