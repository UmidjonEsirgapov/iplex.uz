                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief contents:</strong><br/><strong>Conveniences of the current system Option to choose 5 courses Today, after taking the test, applicants will find out their results within 1 day and have the right to choose five courses based on their score.</strong><br/><strong>Super contract option can enter.</strong><br/><strong>Actually, he could enter other universities with this score on the basis of a contract.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>What were the entrance exams for applicants before?</h2> <p>Previously, the tests were a very stressful and problematic process. Applicants prepared by working hard and reading tons of books throughout the year. But one wrong answer could ruin all dreams. It was common for an applicant who scored 173.1 points to fail because he was only 2.2 points short.</p> <p>Even then, there were no options such as <strong>choosing 5 courses</strong> or <strong>super-contract</strong>. Some people could study in November-December only through unofficial means - "dop contract". And this was only dependent on familiarity and money.</p> <h2>Conveniences of the current system</h2> <h3>Option to choose 5 courses</h3> <p>Today, after taking the test, applicants will know their result within 1 day and have the right to <strong>choose five courses</strong> depending on their score.</p> <h3>Super-contract opportunity</h3> <p>If he is unable to enter from all five directions, the applicant can enroll on the basis of a <strong>super-contract</strong>. Now you don't have to go to anyone's door, look for an acquaintance or pay a bribe. The application is submitted completely online, depending on the sequence of points, the university itself sends an offer to the students.</p> <h3>Possibility of the sixth course</h3> <p>For the vacant quotas of this year, the applicants were also given the right to <strong>choose the sixth course</strong>. This creates more opportunities for young people.</p> <h2>If the goal is determined, a way will be found</h2> <p>For example, one applicant who got 173.1 points only chose jurisprudence at the <strong>Law University</strong> and could not enter because he was only 2.2 points short. In fact, he could enter other universities on a contract basis with this score. But because his goal was clear, he chose only the Law University and did not use the remaining opportunities.</p> <p>Now he can calmly enter the university of his dreams through a super-contract. He starts studying only by paying 2.5 times the amount of the regular contract and will have the opportunity to continue on the basis of a regular contract or grant in the following years. The admission process has become fair and transparent thanks to the choice of five courses, super-contract and additional opportunities. Therefore, it is enough to make good use of the opportunities, study well and stick to the goal. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/soglom-uyqu-uchun-qancha-uxlash-kerak" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p>
