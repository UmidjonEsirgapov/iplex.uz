                Important news for students and applicants.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>If you do these things, I can say that your Writing score will increase by half or one point; A common situation in writing is to focus on using difficult words to show vocabulary.</strong><br/><strong>- Today there are many English language teachers.</strong><br/><strong>A simple example is to prepare with a teacher who has no IELTS level at all and get 7-7.5, and study with a teacher with IELTS level 8 and above and get 5.5 we saw students who could not pass.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Dilmurad Khudoykulov was born in Uzun district of Surkhandarya region. After finishing school, he started studying at the academic lyceum under JIDU in the capital. While studying at the lyceum, he prepared for English and scored 7 points in the IELTS exam in the 3rd year.</p> <p>Our teacher entered TDYU in 2019 and started teaching English from the very beginning of his student life. In 2021, he will join the ranks of the teachers of the "Registon" educational project. Now one of our qualified pedagogues whose students have scored up to 7.5 points!</p> <p>Today, taking into account the demands and suggestions, we arranged an interview with Dilmurod Khudoykulov. Please read!</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>– What does IELTS give the student? What is its role in our life?</strong></p> <p>- IELTS has changed the life of many of my acquaintances, if not 180 degrees, at least 120-130 degrees. Especially, due to reading texts and articles on various topics, your outlook will expand and your thinking will improve.</p> <p>Do you know that there is a big difference between students who got 5.5 and 7 points in IELTS, not only in their knowledge of the English language, but also in their outlook. A student with a score of 7 will have an independent opinion and conclusions after reading various topics. A student with a score of 5.5 has noticeable weaknesses in this regard. In addition, the doors of the world open to a person who has taken IELTS. If you make an effort, various scholarships and educational grants will be "waiting" for you. Naturally, your goals will be big, you will not get wrapped up in small dreams. If you don't mention the financial side, there will be no obstacles...</p> <p><strong>- Some students change their teacher almost every month. There are few young people who are trained under one mentor until they achieve results. What is the reason for this?</strong></p> <p>- They say, "Whatever teacher you start training with, continue with that teacher until the end." I cannot fully agree with this opinion. Because the level of the teacher plays an important role here. For example, some teachers may not be able to prepare students for IELTS, even if they have strong grammar skills. In such cases, it is necessary to change the teacher after acquiring the knowledge taught by that teacher. In this situation, it would be better if our teachers looked for the fault on themselves. But if the teacher's knowledge is strong in all aspects, and the student believes that he will achieve his goal with that teacher, then it is better not to go anywhere else. students who want to continue with me. I will make them like a grown tree. If you move them to another place, it will be difficult for them to catch and bruise. I mean, it is difficult to work with a student who has been trained by a teacher who does not understand IELTS well. If I have a student from Beginner to IELTS, I will take care and supervise him properly. Just like a gardener takes care of a tree from its budding...</p> <p><strong>- Many students who have just started English are reading different books like Band 8, Band 9, doesn't this steal their time? How useful are these books?</strong></p> <p>– This question is very painful! You say that those who have started to prepare, I know people who believe in language teaching books, wait for results, waste their time, and are fooled by illusions without ever going to a tutor. I think this is one of the things that steals the time of many people and fills their belly with empty nuts.</p> <p>Students think that if I use the words given as "Highlight" in Band 8 or Band 9 books, my IELTS will be high. <strong>This is a mistake!</strong> True, in Writing, it is said to use "Less common lexical recourse". But it is also important to pay attention to the basic meaning of the word used, its positive or negative aspects, and what words it is used together with! Because if the word you are using is wrong, then it fits the 5-point rating system. Better yet, it is desirable for students to understand and apply the words found in the articles they read.</p> <p><strong>- Today, the number of people going to study and work abroad has increased significantly. Some of them first learn English, take IELTS and then leave, while many are starting a new life at risk. What do you think about it?</strong></p> <p>– IELTS is the main tool for getting out. Many may say that IELTS is not necessary. True, in most cases it is not necessary, you just need to prove that you know English. But if we look at the other side of the coin, a person who has prepared for IELTS will have partially familiarized himself with the tasks that can be given in universities while completing the tasks of Reading and Listening.</p> <p>For example, if I have been studying and teaching IELTS for 7 years, I can easily tell you about the system, what the classes are like, the level of the tasks, and the lectures in foreign universities. Even now, if I am assigned to read a book in class, I can easily read and understand it. This skill is formed through IELTS. As for the idea that he is taking a risk, let him be happy, whether he is willing to take the challenge!</p> <p><strong>- There are many choices for those who are just starting to prepare for the English language: training centers, individual lessons, online courses, YouTube</strong><strong>, etc. Which of them is useful for the student?</strong></p> <p>- If the student's level is Beginner or Elementary, it is better to learn from a teacher. True, there are lessons that are well covered in social networks, but we are human - we make mistakes. If there is no teacher who will tell us about these mistakes, then it will be too late for us to learn not to make those mistakes. Therefore, it is better for students who are starting from the beginning to get a teacher.</p> <p>Again, it is difficult to say something about this. Because everyone's ability and mastery level is different, someone learns better in a team, while someone learns better through independent education. Someone else achieves good results in individual education, and so on. The most important thing is not to stop and to be able to achieve results with the time-consuming process. There are many people who take the IELTS exam in other countries. They explain that they will raise the score abroad, easy questions will fall... What is your reaction to this?</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/5/1100__dMaZVYrXpAUIU39FsIE329W60Pit-S5O.jpg"/></p> <p>- Actually, I have heard that if I take the IELTS in Kazakhstan or Tajikistan, they give a higher score. There are also views that the IELTS level is evaluated based on the general situation of the candidates in that country. One thing to note is that no matter where you take the IELTS, the questions will not change. If you answer in a different, more interesting way than the candidates think, if you prove to them that you are unusual in general, they may give you half a point higher. What methods do you use to improve Writing'<strong>?</strong></p> <p>- There are many reasons why you may not score well in Writing. Here are the main ones:</p> <ul> <li>Improving writing takes a lot of time. It is impossible to pick it up in 1-2 months, just like Reading;</li> <li>Writing always needs the opinions of someone stronger than you, who will tell you your mistakes and shortcomings. In addition, reading plays an important role in this process. I myself have bought a lot of books to improve my writing. If you do these things, I can say that your Writing score will go up by half or a point;</li> <li>Writing often focuses on using difficult words to show vocabulary. As a result, there is no question of moving away from the essence of the question. This also lowers the score.</li> </ul> <p><strong>– Although many students read with a yawn, the accent in their pronunciation does not disappear. What method do you use to solve this problem?</strong></p> <p>– I have one method to eliminate the accent that I do a lot with my students. The name is Shadowing. In this case, an English or American speaker with excellent English pronunciation will be recorded and recorded. And the students are asked to learn its pronunciation and repeat it as it is and send it as an audio. We often perform such tasks from motivational or famous speeches. And the result is not bad, I recommend it to others!</p> <p><strong>– 3 most important recommendations for those who put off learning English and do not find motivation?</strong></p> <p>– First of all, the world is changing rapidly, and in this situation, not only English, but also any other language person is not one, but ten steps ahead</p> <p></p> <p>. As Konsta said in one of his songs, "Choose, if you want, move with us in the rhythm of life, or follow us in five years, follow us", it is necessary and necessary to learn English not only from peers, but also to keep up with the times.</p> <p>Learning the second language brings additional income. For example, you can teach English to others. In addition, you can understand any material, literature or movies in English in its original voice.</p> <p>Thirdly, read my first and second recommendations again!</p> <p><strong>- There are many English teachers today. What should students pay attention to in this process? The teacher's IELTS score, how many years the teacher has lived in a foreign country, which university he graduated from, how many of his students have taken the IELTS?...</strong></p> <p>- Rather than the level of the teacher, it is necessary to pay attention to his ability to teach and explain. In addition, the character of the teacher and student should be compatible with each other. Because even though the teacher is strong, if the student does not like him, he will not be able to learn anything and his efforts will be ineffective.</p> <p>If the student's level is Beginner, then the teacher's IELTS level is not so important. A simple example, we saw students who studied with a teacher who did not have an IELTS level at all and got 7-7.5, and students who studied with a teacher with an IELTS level of 8 and higher and could not exceed 5.5. <strong>"Kars" comes out of two hands</strong>, there are many aspects that need to be paid attention to, you should analyze all of them from the beginning and read where it is worth spending your valuable time. The important thing is that you don't regret looking back after taking a certain path. <strong>For example, the educational project "Registon" can help you closely in this regard...</strong></p> <p><img class="size-medium wp-image-22209 aligncenter" src="https://rgn.uz/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2-photo_2022-09-25_22-52-11-300x300.jpg"/> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ieltsdan-yuqori-ball-olish-uchun-qanday-tayyorlanish-kerak" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Thank you for the meaningful conversation!</strong></li> </ul> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
