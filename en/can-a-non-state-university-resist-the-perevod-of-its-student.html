                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>One of the most common questions among students is if a student studying at a non-state higher education institution wants to transfer his studies to another (especially state) university, can it be prevented? transfer is carried out on the basis of the "Regulation on the procedure for transfer, reinstatement and expulsion of students" approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan.</strong><br/><strong>Conclusion A non-state university does not have the right to expel you as a student because you want to transfer to another university - unless you give written consent.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2> can it be prevented?</h2> <p>One of the most common questions among students is <strong>if a student studying at a non-state higher education institution wants to transfer his studies to another (especially a state) university, can it be prevented?</strong> At the same time, some non-state universities have warned students that <strong>"if you fail the transfer exam, we will not accept you again"</strong> there are cases. Is this situation legal? Let's analyze it on a legal basis.</p> <h3>How is the procedure for transferring studies regulated?</h3> <p>Students are transferred to another higher education institution based on <strong>the Regulation on the Procedure for Transferring, Reinstating and Excluding Students from Studies</strong> approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan.</p> <ul> <li> <p>According to <strong>Clause 30</strong> of the Regulation, expulsion of a student based on the transfer of studies to another HEI is carried out with the written consent of the student.</p> </li> <li> <p>This means that if you cannot pass the transfer test to another university, if your studies at the previous university have not been terminated <strong>through a written application</strong>, you still You are not a student at that university.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Is it legal for a non-state university to say "we will not send you back"?</h3> <p><strong>No, it is not legal.</strong> It is against the existing law for a non-state university to automatically expel a student because he wants to transfer his studies to another university or because he failed a test.</p> <p>📌 Only Expulsion from studies is possible based on <strong>written consent of the student (i.e. application)</strong>. Otherwise, the student has the right to continue his studies.</p> <h3>How should the student ensure his safety?</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Do not apply in writing <strong>before</strong> entering the transfer test.</p> </li> <li> <p>First successfully pass the test of the new HEI, <strong>after</strong> write an application and get an official letter from the old HEI. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you are under pressure, you can contact <strong>the Ministry of Higher Education or the "legal portals" of the Ministry of Justice.</strong></p> </li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>A private university does not have the right to expel you as a student because you want to transfer to another university - <strong>if you do not give written consent.</strong> It is important for students to know and protect their rights during the transfer process. Did you fail the test? Do not worry - you are a student of the previous university until written consent. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/jismoniy-tarbiya-universitetiga-oqishga-kiritish-vadasi-bilan-direktor-orinbosari-ushlandi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
