                Here's the latest news in the field of education:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>But after a while, you'll notice that you've been surfing the Internet for hours. </strong><br/> <p>Every time you want to prepare for an exam, the devil gets into Telegram, and then you say, "I'm not distracted anymore, I'll focus on the exam." You'll be happy after a while You've been distracted for hours.</p> <p>I understand that this situation is very annoying. You may be thinking, "Oh, sorry." There is an easy solution to this. You don't need to use your willpower or money to make it happen.</p> <p>In order not to be distracted, you need to create an environment where it is impossible to be distracted.</p> <p>For example, are you distracted on the phone during class? install a blocking program. I wrote about how to use the program here (https://t.me/kaktuschilar_uz/170?single).</p> <p>If you are distracted by the TV, unplug the TV and put it out of your sight until the exam. Or go to a place where it is not possible to watch TV. Go to the library. Let the library be a place where no one talks. Now you can say that I need to prepare for the exam. Even if it costs a little money, take out everything you study on the Internet. You can download everything you need from the Internet at once Make it impossible to turn on the class time. Or you can say that you have to help the people at home. So, someone will prepare for the exam by eliminating the possibility of distraction you know.</p> <p><strong>Avalboyev Sukhrob</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/dtm-imtihoni-nomalum-muddatga-kechiktirildi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
