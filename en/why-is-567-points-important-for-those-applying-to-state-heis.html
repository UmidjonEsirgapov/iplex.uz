                Today's most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>In particular, 56.7 points is the lowest fee-contract passing score, and those who score below it only have a super-contract option. the set minimum score is 68.0 (that is, 36% of the maximum 189 points).</strong><br/><strong>Those with points below 56.7 can study only through super-contract. The most important point is that the only way for applicants who scored less than 56.7 points is to study on the basis of super-contract.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Why 56.7 points go to state HEIs Is it important for those who passed it?</h2> <p>The score limits set for applicants for admission to state higher education institutions are of decisive importance for student admission. In particular, <strong>56.7 points</strong> is the lowest passing score on the basis of payment-contract, and those who score below it only have the option of <strong>super-contract</strong>.</p> <h3>The minimum score for a state grant is 68.0</h3> <p>The <strong>minimum score set for admission to study on the basis of a state grant is 68.0</strong> (i.e. the maximum 36 percent of 189 points). This means that the applicants who want to apply for study on the basis of a grant must reach this score.</p> <h3>The minimum score for a fee-contract is 56.7</h3> <p>Also, <strong>the minimum score for admission to study on the basis of a fee-contract is set as 56.7</strong>. This is 30% of the maximum score of 189. If the applicant scores below this indicator, even if the quota is free in the chosen field, he cannot become a student on the basis of a regular contract. reading. This requires much higher costs than a simple contract.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>56.7 points is an important psychological and official threshold for entering state HEIs. If you do not get this score, you will only be able to become a student through a super contract. Therefore, every score is important, every question's solution determines the fate. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/dunyo-boylab-hamyonbop-xalqaro-universitetlar-kipr-garbiy-universiteti-bakalavr-dasturlari-va-grantlar" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources.
