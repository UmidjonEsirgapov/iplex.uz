According to Article 14 of the Regulation on the remuneration of public education workers, it is allowed to conduct up to 10 hours of classes per week by the head of a public education institution. These lesson hours should be according to their specialty. According to Clause 12 of the Regulations, the director and his deputies are paid for the hours of study on an hourly basis. At the same time, these teaching hours should be released to the regional labor body as a vacancy.</p> <p><strong>According to paragraph 15 of the regulation "On the procedure for the completion of classes in general educational institutions and the formation of tariff lists", in cases where teachers with higher education are not provided, the leading staff of the general educational institution can teach in the relevant specialty.</strong></p> <p>However, this opportunity given only after all employees have been fully provided with the lesson, in case of increased hours.
