                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>No, you can't choose.</strong><br/><strong>Many people think that if I have passed all five directions, I will choose any one. </strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>No, you can't choose.</strong></p> <p>Many people think that if I have passed all five courses, I can choose any one of them. <strong>This is a misconception.</strong></p> <p>Applicants chose five courses in a row when applying. Also, they have already determined <strong>priorities</strong> for the state grant and payment contract.</p> <p>Now, after the final answers are released today, the applicants cannot change their courses of study. The computer itself determines which direction it entered in order of priority. It doesn't matter if the priority is a state grant or a route.</p> <p>On the mandat.uzbmb.uz site, whichever route is highlighted in green (grant) or blue or yellow (contract), <strong>is entered in that route.</strong> The name of the route entered in parentheses is also written below. This cannot be changed. It is <strong>impossible to go up or down in the sequence of routes.</strong></p> <p><strong><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/5/1100__CwS9-3MX3gf4fS2O562eYIQFMbHbVNsD.png"/></strong></p> <p>Now the system is changing from next year, in which the applicant takes the test first, then which chooses to study in the direction. Then you will have the right to choose, this year it is not possible.</p> <p> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/toshkent-axborot-texnologiyalari-universitetida-koreyaning-nufuzli-universitetlari-bilan-qoshma-talim-dasturlariga-qabul-boshlandi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
