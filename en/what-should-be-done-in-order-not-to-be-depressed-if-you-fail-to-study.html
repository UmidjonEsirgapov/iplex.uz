                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>I would say to the young people who are applying for studies that a person should not bet on only one thing.</strong><br/><strong>Study is important, but one should make other plans instead of judging life only by entering the university.</strong><br/><strong>What kind of person will I be if I can't enter? The more an applicant begins to think like this, the heavier one part of the scale will be - it will go down, and the other will go up. I would tell the young people who are applying for studies that <strong>a person should not bet all his opportunities on only one thing.</strong> The mistake of many of our applicants is that they spend their opportunities on only one thing. That's why he considers it very important to study. Studying is important, but life should not be judged only by entering the university, but also make other plans. For example, if I can't apply or get into medical school this year, what can I do next year? The applicant should think about the answer to this question before entering the <strong>test. </strong> <p>It can be prepared again next year. Or he can work and study. He can prepare for IELTS and set other big goals for this year. It is necessary to define 2 or 3 such plans. Then the importance of the same thing decreases. </p> <p>So, if I can't achieve this thing, I have a second way, and if that doesn't work, I have a third way. The existence of such a number of options diminishes the importance of the first goal. <strong>When we understand what is important in life</strong>, it starts to come to us even faster.</p> <p>This world was created with balance. There are two sides to the scale. Both are equal. When we consider something important, one part of the scale is weighed and the other is raised. For example, if we see in the situation of entering a university, "I have to enter the university. I can't go in. What am I to say if I can't get in?" The more the applicant begins to think like this, the heavier one part of the scale becomes - it goes down, and the other goes up. </p> <p>Imagine how low the scale suddenly leveled when you failed to study. In such an equation, a person falls into despair. Everything cools down. The worst thing is that his self-confidence will drop. A person falls into a state of severe depression. Because that's exactly what he made important in life. For this reason, it is necessary to make other options and put small stones on this part of the scale. Such people have high self-confidence. At the same time, the chances of a person with high self-confidence to study will also increase. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oquvchilarni-akademik-litseylarga-qabul-qilishning-yangi-tartibi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p></strong>
