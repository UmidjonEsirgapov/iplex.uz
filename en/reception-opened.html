                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Registration dates and process Applicants can register to take part in the tests from June 5 to June 25 (including June 25). At the same time, if the entrance exams include a professional (creative) exam, the applicant must also choose the higher education institution where the creative exam will be taken.</strong><br/><strong>News on taking the professional (creative) exam One of the important aspects is that applicants can take a creative exam in any region.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Registration for applicants has begun - apply through my.uzbmb.uz submit</h2> <p>The process of online registration of applicants for the 2025-2026 academic year began on <strong>June 5</strong>. Now all applicants can apply to participate in the tests through the official platform <strong>my.uzbmb.uz</strong> until June 25.</p> <h3>Registration dates and process</h3> <p>Applicants can register to participate in the tests from <strong>June 5 to June 25</strong> (including June 25). During the application process, only the following information is selected:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The <strong>complex of subjects for which the test will be taken</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>The language of education</strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>The region of the test</strong></p> </li> </ul> <p>At the same time, if the applicant's entrance exams include a <strong>professional (creative) exam</strong> in that case, he will have to choose <strong>the HEI where the creative exam will be taken.</strong></p> <h3>News on taking the professional (creative) exam</h3> <p>One of the important aspects is that applicants can take the creative exam in any region. For example, if someone wants to enter the University of Journalism and Mass Communication of Uzbekistan, he can take the creative exam in Andijan, Bukhara or other regions. This creates regional convenience for applicants.</p> <h3>Teaching area: Special attention to Sokh and Denov</h3> <p>Another new possibility is that <strong>Sokh</strong> and <strong>Denov</strong> districts can be selected as a separate test area. Sokh people don't have to go to Ferghana, and Denov people don't have to go to Termiz. This saves travel expenses and time.</p> <h3>Payment procedure: For those who graduated in previous years</h3> <p>If the applicant graduated from school in previous years, he must pay <strong>187,500 soums</strong> to participate in the test. This payment must be made before June 25. It is also possible to pay in installments, but if it is late, it will not be included in the test.</p> <h3>Possibility to change the application</h3> <p>Applicants who change their mind can <strong>resubmit</strong> the application until June 25. This process is important for changing test subjects, language of instruction, or test area. <strong>No changes will be made after June 25.</strong></p> <h3>Exam Dates</h3> <p><strong>Entrance exams will be held in July-August.</strong> Specific dates will be announced separately. It is important to properly plan the time to prepare for the exam.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The process of registering applicants for the new academic year has begun. Use the opportunities wisely: choose a test site near your area, take the professional exam at any HEI, update the application on time and do not delay payment. The registration process has been simplified and convenient opportunities have been created for applicants. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/5/5-sinf-biologiya" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education..
