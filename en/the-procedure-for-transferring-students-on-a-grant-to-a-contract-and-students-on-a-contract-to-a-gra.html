                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>This procedure was created for all students to test their knowledge and increase their chances.</strong><br/><strong>This procedure also applies to students who received a grant based on the privilege. possible.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Procedure of transfer of students on a grant to a contract, students on a contract to a grant</h2> <p>Each year in state higher education institutions <strong>depending on the level of knowledge of students</strong> the forms of study are redistributed on the basis of grant and contract. This procedure is designed for all students to test their knowledge and increase their chances. Below you will find detailed information about this process.</p> <h3>How does this procedure work?</h3> <p>The <strong>study results</strong> (rating indicators) of students who have completed the 1st year are taken into account. Students with high grades can be transferred from a contract to a grant, and those with low grades can be transferred from a grant to a contract. That is, redistribution is carried out at the end of each academic year.</p> <h3>Does it apply to masters?</h3> <p>Yes, the same procedure is used at the master's level. Master's students can also be transferred to a grant or contract depending on their study results.</p> <h3>Does it also apply to those who entered the grant with a privilege?</h3> <p>This procedure also applies to students admitted to the grant based on the privilege. If they do not maintain the results of their studies, there is a possibility of falling into the contract.</p> <h3>What about those who enrolled on the basis of targeted admission?</h3> <p>Students who have a grant based on targeted admission may also fall into the contract depending on their grades. The general procedure is also applied to their grant.</p> <h2>Important note</h2> <p>Students enrolled on the basis of a state grant should not put aside their studies, saying, "I enrolled, that's it." Because after 1 year, when the grant is redistributed, they may fall into the contract. Students enrolled on the basis of a contract should not be discouraged, because after 1 year there is an opportunity to transfer to a grant by showing high results.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The transition procedure between a grant and a contract is a fair system introduced to encourage students. This routine encourages you to learn regularly. Therefore, every student should make the most of their opportunities and take a serious approach to studying. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ona-tili-va-tarix-boyicha-sertifikati-bor-oqituvchilarga-50-foiz-ustama-tolanadimi-prezident-qarori" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
