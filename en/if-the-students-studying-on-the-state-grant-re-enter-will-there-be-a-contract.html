                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>In particular, a clear procedure has been established for students studying on the basis of a state grant. </strong><br/><strong>Conclusion If a student studying on a state grant wants to receive higher education again, a grant will not be allocated for that stage and he will study under a contract.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>If a student studying on a state grant resubmits again, will he have a contract?</h2> <p>Some news in the higher education system based on the Presidential Decree of May 25, 2024 was introduced. Especially for students studying on the basis of a state grant, a clear procedure has been established for the cases of re-submission.</p> <h3>What did the previous year's writing say?</h3> <p>Last year, the following message appeared in the personal office of some applicants:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Because you were recommended for studentship on the basis of a state grant in previous years, you cannot participate in the competition for a state grant this year."</p> </blockquote> <p>This writing caused confusion among many people. This issue was clarified by the new presidential decree.</p> <h2>What will change according to the new regulation?</h2> <h3>Secondary and further higher education - on the basis of a contract</h3> <p>According to the presidential decree, now:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Secondary and further higher education</strong> is carried out only <strong>on a fee-contract basis</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A student who received a state grant for <strong>one stage</strong> of higher education, if he <strong>reads this stage again</strong>, the grant will not be allocated to him.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>In what cases will the state grant not be allocated?</h3> <ul> <li> <p>If the student studied with a state grant in the 1st stage, and then to the 1st stage again the following year if he begins to transfer to another direction - <strong>he studies on the basis of a contract</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p>But later, i.e. from the 2nd level, if his mastery is high, he <strong>has the right to return to the state grant</strong>.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Who does this apply to?</h2> <h3>For students currently studying</h3> <ul> <li> <p>The current student can leave his place and re-submit as an applicant.</p> </li> <li> <p>However, <strong>repeated grant will not be allocated</strong> for the stage he studied on the basis of the previous grant - he will have to study under a contract.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>What if he studied under a grant for two years or more?</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Even if such a student can re-apply for studies, he can transfer to a state grant only in the 3rd or 4th year stages.</p> </li> <li> <p>So, <strong>starting stages in a new direction will be only in the contract</strong>.</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>A student who studied with a state grant can return to higher education. if he wants to study, a grant is not allocated for that stage and he studies under a contract. However, based on a high learning rate, there is a possibility to switch to a state grant in the next courses. Although this procedure existed in the previous legislation, it was officially strengthened by the Presidential Decree and is being used in practice. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/yaponiya-bakalavr-va-magistratura-talabalari-uchun-qiymati-taxminan-910-aqsh-dollari-miqdorida-oylik-stipendiya" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
