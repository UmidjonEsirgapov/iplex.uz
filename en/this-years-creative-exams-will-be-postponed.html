A delay of 5-6 days in the exam period will not affect their duration and quality.</strong></p> <p>The Minister of Higher and Secondary Special Education Inomjon Majidov announced at a briefing held at AOKA that the creative exams will be delayed due to the new quarantine restrictions.</p> <p>"Creative exams were supposed to start on July 25. However, there will be a change in their duration due to the strengthening of quarantine restrictions. Creative exams will begin after August 1. A delay of 5-6 days in the examination period does not affect their duration and quality. The reason is that the exams are scheduled for 20 days and this period will not change," the Kun.uz reporter quoted the minister as saying.</p> <p>Also, Inomjon Majidov stated that there are no difficulties in submitting documents to HEIs, documents are accepted online for all forms of education, <strong> creative, full-time, part-time</strong> forms of education.</p> <p><strong>"In addition, a decision is made based on the situation about when and how to start studying. It will also depend on what the quarantine restrictions will be and when the tests will be held," Inomjon Majidov noted. We would like to remind you that earlier it was announced that the exams for those who will take the exam in the professional-creative direction (for which there is no test) will last from July 25 to August 20.</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/abituriyentlar-uchun-muhim-yangilik" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other educational news.
