                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Document submission procedure Documents for the master's degree can be submitted from July 1 to July 30 (including July 30). a total of 10,425 students are scheduled to be accepted.</strong><br/><strong>If the entrance exams for the master's degree will be in the form of an online test, a natural question arises as to whether it is possible to submit to several courses at the same time and participate in the exam. </strong> <p><strong>Document submission procedure</strong></p> <p>Documents for the master's degree can be submitted <strong>from July 1 to July 30 (including July 30)</strong>.</p> <p>Documents are submitted online through the magistr.edu.uz site. Documents are <strong>not accepted at HEIs.</strong></p> <p><strong>Documents needed to formalize admission:</strong></p> <p>– passport (scanning or photo version of the passport is not required, you just need to enter JShSIR number, passport series and number in the required places);</p> <p>– scanned version of the application for the bachelor’s degree and grades;</p> <p>– foreign language certificate, Olympiads documents confirming the winner, the president or the holder of a named scholarship, etc. (if any).</p> <p>The applicant is not required to submit additional documents (such as a photo, copy of articles, medical certificate). allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://ok.ru/videoembed/1564881455807"&gt; <p><strong>Admission quotas</strong></p> <p>In the current academic year, a total of <strong>10,425 students</strong> have been admitted to the <strong>master's level</strong> of education across the republic. </p> <p>Of these, <strong>5,475 people study on a </strong>grant basis, <strong>4,950 people study on a </strong>fee-contract basis.</p> <p>The distribution of quotas by majors can be found in the following file:</p> <p><strong>Master's quotas: distribution by majors and languages (.pdf)</strong></p> <p><strong>Directions selection</strong></p> <p><strong>By the presidential decision of June 17, 2019, the restrictions for undergraduates to choose master's courses were canceled. That is, a student can choose the direction of his/her master's degree regardless of the field of study. There are only a few exceptions.</strong></p> <p>One more point. Except for bachelors who have graduated from bachelor's degree programs suitable for master's degree, graduates of other bachelor's degree programs cannot take part in the competition for master's degree specialties with target admission parameters determined on the basis of state grants. due to the conditions, it will be conducted online in the form of a test.</p> <p>Test questions to determine the scientific-pedagogical ability (or learning ability) of applicants in relevant fields of specialization are also included in the composition of the entrance exams for the master's degree (in particular, in the composition of the entrance tests for specialized subjects). a natural question arises. No, it is not possible.</p> <p>"First of all, no regulatory document stipulates that it is possible to apply for several courses at the master's degree. Secondly, when a bachelor applies for a master's degree in one direction, this data is saved in the database, and the platform does not accept a second attempt to apply," Farhod Babashev, head of the information service of the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education, told Kun.uz.</p> <p><strong>Exception:</strong> <em>Entrance exams for the master's degree at Tashkent State Law University are held in spacious pavilions. Test procedures for TDUU master's degree are organized by the State Testing Center.</em> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oliygoh/ozbekiston-milliy-universiteti-jizzax-filiali" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.</p>
