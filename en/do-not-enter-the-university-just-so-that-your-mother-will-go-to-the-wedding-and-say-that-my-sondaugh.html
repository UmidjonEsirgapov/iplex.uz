                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>If a graduate, after being hired, the knowledge he acquired during four years is completely useless for the job market, if he spends a certain amount of time and participates in seminars and training courses and goes on probation as an apprentice without receiving a salary, he cannot at least pass the probation... this kind of education cannot be considered high-quality... Unfortunately, we have not yet fully formed the right view of the private sector, especially private universities.</strong><br/><strong>Don't enter a university just to get a diploma or when your parents go to the wedding to say that my son/daughter has a higher education.</strong><br/><strong>It is the same not only in the state, but also in the private sector.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>August. The moment when Galvir rises from the water. We are at an important stage that gives people exciting moments that will be remembered for a lifetime. Entrants apply the knowledge they have gained for a year and achieve the status of a student. They say goodbye to training centers and preparatory courses and embark on a big life. They either return to the street of life called "Class" or not...</p> <p>5-10 years ago, entering school was extremely painful, becoming a student was considered an impossible dream, and "failing" was considered a "black mark" that hurt the head. He did not leave his house thinking about the fact that he could not walk in the neighborhood of those who dropped out of school. How many girls fell to the ground because they couldn't go to school; There are countless young men who went to work for a long time, labored, and hit their head against the wall because they didn't finish their studies, heh...</p> <p>Indeed, starting to study was considered an important event. Only 2-3 people from one village or neighborhood (usually not even that much) studied at the Higher Education Institution, naturally, their fame spread to seven neighborhoods and they were admired by everyone. How they got into education is another matter, because it was a time when corruption was rampant and education was almost ignored. The important thing is that they are married, they are studying, and they set their children as an example in every field! Their ranks are expanding year by year. But it cannot be done without building rice, and there are several aspects that we need to pay attention to...</p> <p>If you look at HEIs today, most students look like patients suffering from aimlessness syndrome. Maybe it seems like this because our eyes are used to the hot atmosphere, "flame" atmosphere in all branches of our "Registon" training center in the regions, we didn't know. In our opinion, most of the students go to study, not to learn, but to pass the time because they are bored, and they spend the most important part of their life sleeping. After all, 18-25 years of age is the time when you build your future or destroy it!</p> <p>According to the opinion of Akhtam Yakubov, the rector of the first private higher education institution in Kashkadarya, Karshi International University, doctor of legal sciences and mediator, Akhtam Yakubov, the higher education market is not bad now. According to my "forecast", after 4-5 years there will be a huge drop in this market. After 3-4 years, there will be "massive" unemployed people with diplomas in the society. Why is everyone focusing on IT and private educational institutions, why is "Salvation education" on everyone's lips today? The reason is that young people have the opportunity to monetize the knowledge they have learned while still a student in a short period of time. This opportunity was created only in the private sector, and if the public sector does not rise to this level immediately, our situation is very sad...</p> <p>In its place, universities should prepare students for the next stage - the job market. If, after being employed, the knowledge acquired by a graduate within four years is completely useless for the job market, if he spends a certain amount of time, participates in seminars and training courses, and goes to the test as an apprentice without receiving a salary, if he fails to at least pass the test... such education cannot be considered high-quality...</p> <p>Unfortunately, we have not yet fully formed the right view of the private sector, especially private universities. Young people, who once struggled and were applicants for 4-5 years, now in some sense cannot see those who become students without any exams. It's like a daughter-in-law, who hates her mother-in-law, hates her daughter-in-law after becoming a mother-in-law herself...</p> <p>True, in most private universities, you just have to pay the contract and you will become a student. But this rule (super contract) has been introduced in state universities for a long time. Then, the system in most (not all) private universities is much better than in public universities. If you don't believe it, you can check their web pages and social media pages on the Internet. It is created with all the conditions and freedom for the student to study. In addition, there are no uniforms, hair and beard issues, and no bureaucracy at all. First of all, we need to understand this very well.</p> <p>In general, it is not written anywhere that a student who studies and graduates from a state university becomes a scientist. One of the activists of our society said that our people are so educated that even the pushcart in the market is highly educated - he has a diploma in his chest. Whether it's a state or non-state university, finding a job with a diploma or throwing the diploma in the trunk and becoming a highly educated worker, taxi driver, seller... depends on everyone, on the knowledge they have acquired!</p> <p>Applicants! Don't go to university just to get a diploma or to have your parents say, 'My son/daughter has a higher education' when they go to the wedding. Work hard, study hard, and become an expert in your field. If you always intend to justify the trust and set the right goal, you will definitely become a mature expert in your field!</p> <p>Avoid being among the hordes of unlucky students who graduate every year. If you can, go abroad or learn a trade for that money. Do not enroll with a super contract. Believe me, any education system, let alone a super one, is not worth paying for a simple contract: if you don't try! It is the same not only in the public sector but also in the private sector. If you are relaxed, teachers cannot open the "lid" in your head and put knowledge. The only salvation is yourself, no one can help you but you. In the words of Hazrat Alisher Navoi,</p> <p>"Think about your body,</p> <p>Whatever you want, you want!"</p> <p>Good luck in the exams, let your face be bright! — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/davlat-grantida-qabul-25-foizga-oshirilishi-ehtiyojmand-oilalar-qizlariga-ajratiladigan-grantlar-2-barobarga-kopaytiriladi-oliy-majlis" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources..
