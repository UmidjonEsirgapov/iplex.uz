                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>I started work in September 2022.</strong><br/><strong>Tell me, can I participate in the certification exam?</strong><br/><strong>And in paragraph 7 of the regulation: "Pedagogical personnel who are not involved in the regular mandatory certification can take the extraordinary certification at their own discretion can pass".</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Question</strong>: I graduated from the institute in 2020. I started working in September 2022. I intended to take the fall certification exam. The school administration said, "You will participate in the spring exam, but now you can't." Now, when I said that I will apply for the spring certification, our supervisor said, "You must have worked for 1 year, you cannot participate." Is that right? It's been 5 months since I started working. Can I take the certification exam? Article <strong>6</strong> of the Regulation states: "...pedagogical personnel with less than three years of experience in pedagogical activities" will not be included in the next mandatory attestation.</p> <p>Article <strong>7</strong> of the Regulation states: "Pedagogical personnel who are not involved in the next mandatory attestation may <strong>at their own discretion</strong> undergo extraordinary attestation." marked.</p> <p>P.S. According to the current regulations, you can participate in the <strong>2023 attestation</strong> on an extraordinary basis according to your wish.</p> <p>We recommend that the officials operating at the address specified in the application should familiarize themselves with the <strong>NEW REGULATIONS</strong> again. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/geografiya-fanidan-olimpiada-savollari-tuman-bosqichi-9-11-sinflar-uchun" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.
