                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Advantages of preparing by going to a tutor: - there will be a teacher who will point out your mistakes and tell the right way. interesting to find; a lot of time flies by.</strong><br/><strong>If you go to a tutor for 2 hours 4 times a week for 1 month, the teacher will give you 32-40 hours of lessons; money will be saved.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Now we will compare the advantages and disadvantages of preparing at home and going to a tutor and find out which one is better.</strong></p> <p><strong>The advantage of going to a tutor:</strong> - there will be a teacher who will point out your mistakes and tell you the right way.</p> <p><strong>Going to a tutor to prepare Disadvantages:<img src="https://blog.mangolanguages.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog-2020-language-learning-at-home-hero.jpg?width=1988&amp;name=blog-2020-language-learning-at-home-hero.jpg"/></strong></p> <ul> <li>most learning centers are not interested in going to study, they are interested in earning more money;</li> <li>a lot of time goes by. Before the start of the lesson, the homework of everyone in the group is checked. Even if you understand, if someone doesn't understand, the teacher will explain it again. It's the little things like that that take up your time. If you go to a tutor for 2 hours 4 times a week for 3 months, at least 26 hours out of 104 hours (1 day) will be spent on things that do not benefit you;</li> <li>it takes a lot of time to travel. If you go to a tutor 4 times a week for 3 months, even if it takes half an hour to go and half an hour to return, your 52 hours (2 days) will go away; individual teachers who come to your home are expensive. Some group tutors are also expensive; - the teacher may teach in ways you don't like;</li> <li>some teachers only pass the topic, you still have to remember the information and solve the tests at home.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Advantages of preparing at home:<img src="https://media.baamboozle.com/uploads/images/294733/1662982050_1859317_gif-url.jpeg"/></strong></p> <ul> <li>save time. You can spend the 78 hours (26+52) wasted after going to a tutor for 3 months to learn new things. If you go to a tutor for 2 hours 4 times a week for 1 month, the teacher will give you 32-40 hours of lessons;</li> <li>money will be saved. You don't pay anyone for preparing at home;</li> <li>you prepare for the exam in the ways you like, using the books you like;</li> <li>you can find free videos on the Internet that explain things easier than a tutor.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Disadvantages of preparing at home:</strong></p> <ul> <li>a teacher who shows your mistakes and tells you the right way absence. But you can solve this problem through various tests, exercises, books, they are also teachers, only in written form. If you ask people who know your subject well to look at your mistakes, they will help you for free.</li> </ul> <p>I think it is better to prepare at home. I got maximum score of 189 because of home preparation too. I started preparing for the exam only 4 months before. If I had gone to study centers, I would not have had time to prepare for the exam at all. I prepared at home, saved time and money, and prepared for exams in a way that I liked. As you can see, preparing at home has more advantages.</p> <p><strong>Sukhrob Avalboyev</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/xotin-qizlar-uchun-tavsiyanomalar-oqishga-kirishini-kafolatlaydimi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
