First of all, the phrase "unlimited choice" does not mean choosing the desired field of study, and in order to introduce such a change, it is required to give the same score to the subjects that are given the test, regardless of their sequence. When explained more broadly, "unlimited choice" applies only to the fields of study where the test is given the same. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/yangi-oquv-yili-uchun-super-kontrakt-narxlari" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/>This information is taken from official sources.
