                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>ANSWER: All benefits are counted, if you did not get admission, then your score is not enough.</strong><br/><strong>‼️ First of all, this benefit (recommendation) does not add any points.</strong><br/><strong>You need to get enough points for this. </strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> All the benefits were counted, if you could not enter the study, then your score was not enough.</p> <p>This year too, a place has been reserved for <strong>2 thousand additional state grants</strong> for women (popularly called <strong>4% grant</strong>). These <strong>2 thousand seats</strong> are distributed across regions and disciplines.</p> <p>‼️ <strong>Firstly, this privilege (recommendation) does not add any points.</strong></p> <p>Many people mistakenly thought that 4% points should be added. <strong>Don't wait, no points will be added to you.</strong></p> <p><strong>Secondly, it does not mean that 100% of applicants with female recommendation will be admitted.</strong> For this, you need to get enough points. </p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/7/1100__a-XB8TlsVNgKznpC24lfGtZJsRP_wF1R.png"/></p> <p>The <strong>2024 passing scores</strong> for women who received recommendations are shown in the photo above. Those who got less than this score are not given a discount.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Here, it is also important in which subject group the course you submit belongs to. Unfortunately, due to the division of quotas into sectors, in some regions they were admitted to the grant with <strong>69 points</strong>, and in some places they were not recommended even with <strong>160 points</strong>. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ozbekiston-xalqaro-biologiya-olimpiadasidan-chetlatildi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
