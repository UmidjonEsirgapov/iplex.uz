                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Have the scholarships increased? <p><strong>Have the scholarships increased?</strong></p> <p>No. As you know, with the decree of the President, salaries, pensions and allowances of employees of budget organizations are increasing by 7%.</p> <p>Students' stipends have not increased, nothing is said about this in the decree. is tied to the minimum amount of payment. That is, as a rule, when the amount of payment for labor increases, contracts also increase.</p> <p>However, it is better not to rush to conclusions. The reason is that the number of contracts has not been increased for several years after the pandemic, it remains the same. Although the amount of remuneration for labor has increased several times, but the contracts have not been increased. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kaust-vsrp-fully-funded-internship-saudiya-arabistonida-toliq-moliyalashtriluvchi-amaliyot-dasturi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p></strong>
