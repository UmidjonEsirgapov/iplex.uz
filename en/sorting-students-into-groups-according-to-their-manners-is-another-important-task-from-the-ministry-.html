                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The rectors of HEIs have been instructed to "urgently" compile a list of students who are prone to crime, who are on the verge of being influenced by foreign ideas and who do not follow the rules.</strong><br/><strong>Photo: Kun.uz On February 14, rectors and branch directors of HEIs in the republic the minister of education, science and innovation Ibrahim Abdurahmanov sent the task with the label "urgent".</strong><br/><strong>Expert on education Kamil Jalilov, who was one of the first to pay attention to the topic, was the first to draw attention to the topic, based on which criteria to determine whether a student is "prone to crime" or "on the verge of being influenced by foreign ideas", what ideas are meant by "foreign ideas" asked about the list of students who do not follow the rules.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>The rectors of higher education institutions were instructed to "urgently" compile a list of students who are prone to crime, who are on the verge of being influenced by foreign ideas and who do not follow the rules. In the letter received by Kun.uz, there is also a task for students to write comments protecting the honor of the system to opinions and articles on social networks. The task was sent by the Minister of Education, Science and Innovation Ibrahim Abdurahmanov with the label "urgent". src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/Nn8eJOuDoDHR8MCNIsrsLcT5E3wMTuZW.png"/&gt; <p>In that case, the management of higher education institutions should study all students and divide them into 3 conditional groups: <strong>prone to crime, on the verge of being influenced by foreign ideas, and those who do not follow the rules</strong> to create and separate a list of students the received students were assigned the task of connecting the managers and employees of the ministry, higher education institutions, and organizing individual interviews with their parents. In the letter, it was requested to send qualitative information on the execution of the tasks given to higher education institutions at the meeting held by the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation Ibrahim Abdurahmanov within 3 days to the email address j.mirzakarimov@mininnovation.uz (with supporting documents in word and pdf format) with the signature of the first supervisor. No.</p> <p>Expert on education Kamil Jalilov, who was one of the first to pay attention to the topic, raised questions about what criteria are used to determine whether a student is "prone to crime" or "on the verge of being influenced by foreign ideas", what ideas are meant by "foreign ideas", and the list of students who do not comply with which procedures is requested.</p> <p>Jalilov also added that such an initiative of the ministry does not comply with the norms of the Constitution and asked the Ministry of Justice to respond to the situation. "Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, speech and belief." "Every person accused of committing a crime is not considered guilty until the case of a person accused of committing a crime is considered in court in a legal manner and publicly, and his guilt is determined. "The state ensures the rights and freedoms of citizens established in the Constitution and laws." These are the articles of the current Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan.</p> <p>Adding a student (in general, a person) to lists such as "prone to crime", "on the verge of being influenced by foreign ideas", and in general, to what extent is the formation and maintenance of such lists by a state body consistent with the above-mentioned norms of the Constitution and the presumption of innocence? - writes a public activist.</p> <p>Bakhtiyor Sheraliyev, a biologist who worked in China for 5 years after the student set himself on fire in Namangan, and is now the head of the Department of Zoology and General Biology at Fergana State University, also wrote about the fact that higher education is sinking more and more into the swamp. As someone who works within the system, he listed the reasons why higher education is going backwards.</p> <p>“The second biggest factor in the quagmire of higher education is the excessive amount of pointless, useless red tape in higher education. At the same time, higher education institutions, from the management staff to ordinary professors, are so busy that they do not have time to deal with science and the educational process, which is their main function. Every day, the Ministry asks people to fill in some kind of tables," he wrote.</p> <p>In the information sent to the rectors regarding the execution of the task, a number of tasks are set, which raises a rightful question whether this can really be the task of the Higher Education Institution. Among them:</p> <p>- systematically starting the implementation of the installation of solar panels that provide electricity in higher education institutions at their own expense;</p> <p>- providing explanations on the participation of employees in the articles and opinions published on social networks with their opinions on protecting the honor of the system;</p> <p>- Tasks such as the publication of impressive <strong>short stories</strong> are listed in order to warn against the bad vices that appear among young people. remains unanswered.</p> <p>This incident is the second assignment of Minister Ibrahim Abdurahmanov, who has been appointed to the ministry for more than 1 month, which has caused negative discussion. Before that, the minister's warning about the termination of non-state HEIs with a large number of unemployed graduates caused objections. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/otm-uchun-oquv-adabiyotlarini-chop-etishga-ruxsat-berish-davlat-xizmatlari-asosida-tashkil-etiladi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
