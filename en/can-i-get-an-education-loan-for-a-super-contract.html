                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>One of the questions that many people are interested in is this.</strong><br/><strong>Accordingly, the provision of educational loans for super-contracts is not specified in the current legislation. <p><strong>One of the questions that many people are interested in is this.</strong></p> <p><strong>At the time of the adoption of the legislation on the provision of educational loans, there was no such thing as an additional contract. Therefore, this issue is not clearly specified in the regulatory documents. </strong></p> <p>According to the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 318 of July 26, 2001, educational loans can be granted by commercial banks for the study of students admitted to full-time departments of higher education institutions on a fee-contract basis.</p> <p>The word "admitted" is important here. In the additional contract, 100% payment will be made first, after which a decision will be made to accept those applicants by October. Until they make the payment, they are not considered to be accepted as students.</p> <p>Accordingly, the provision of educational loans for the super-contract is not defined in the current legislation.</p> <p>Even if it was allowed, the banks would not give it anyway, I think. Because the educational loan is issued at the refinancing rate, i.e. at 14% per annum. This means that educational loans are "unsuitable" for banks.</p> <p>In addition, large resources are not allocated for educational loans, in such conditions, banks would not want to allocate several hundred million funds for a 14% loan.</p> <p>Taking into account the above, getting a loan from banks for a super-contract is an impossible dream. sarson, let there be a way to 200 million.</p> <p>Jurist Khushnudbek Khudoiberdiyev. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/majburiy-fanlar-2-tadan-3-taga-kopaytirilmaydi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.</strong>
