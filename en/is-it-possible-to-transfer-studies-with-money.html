                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>What is the procedure for transferring studies from state to state?</strong><br/><strong>"My friend decided with money" - this can also be a lie. Many students think: "So-and-so friend transferred studies with money." it is not possible to transfer studies from one state university to another.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Is it possible to transfer studies with money?</h2> <p>One of the most common questions among students is: <strong>"Is it possible to transfer studies to another university with money?"</strong> There are many rumors around this topic. Let's answer this question clearly and without censorship.</p> <h3>What is the procedure for transferring studies from one state to another?</h3> <p>According to the legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan, <strong>transferring studies from one state university to another</strong> is allowed only on the basis of <strong>two valid reasons</strong>:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Study due to marriage</strong> transfer;</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Transfer due to a change of job of a civil servant</strong>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Except for these two cases, transfer of education is not allowed in state HEIs.</p> <h2>Is transfer of education for money a fraud?</h2> <h3>How does the fraud scheme work?</h3> <p>Some people, especially those who say "I know you", "I will solve it", ask you for a "service fee" from $2,000 to $10,000. But this is nothing but <strong>lies and fraud</strong>.</p> <p>They take the money, promise to do your work, and then keep you waiting for months with excuses. A year later, you will realize that you have wasted your money, time and nerves.</p> <h3>Refunds are part of the scam</h3> <p>Those who offer this "service" will eventually tell you the <strong>standard lies</strong>, such as "it doesn't look like it", "the brother above left his job". Sometimes they even partially return the money and escape responsibility. However, at this time, your money will serve as "exchange".</p> <h2>"My friend decided with money" - this can also be a lie. But these statements are often not true. Maybe he hid his condition from you? Or even if he attends classes - it may be done with forged documents and <strong>it will be exposed very quickly</strong>. <p>In recent years, such cases have been exposed, and some students have even been <strong>responsible</strong>.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>It is <strong>impossible</strong> to transfer studies from one state university to another for money. Those who promised you about this are <strong>fraudsters</strong>. They use your hope, your imagination and your money. If you agree to this, you will lose <strong>not only money, but also valuable time and opportunities</strong>. My advice - stay away from this topic! — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/aqshning-michigan-universitetida-oqish-uchun-toliq-va-qisman-moliyalashtiriluvchi-grant-dasturi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other educational news.</h2>
