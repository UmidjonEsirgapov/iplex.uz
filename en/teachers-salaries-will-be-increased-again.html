So who will deliver these new textbooks to our children? Of course, teacher! I will not talk about raising the reputation of my teacher in vain. In today's era of globalization, we are realizing more and more how important education and the development of the next generation are. We are planning our current reforms and setting big goals. They are easy to say but painful to do. But no matter how difficult it may be, we must work to implement these reforms for our children.</p> <p>Today's aspiring children will become your golden fund in the future. You are proud of their achievements. "How am I contributing to my beloved country?!" the answer to the question is our work on ourselves and the development of our children. This issue will be in my constant focus. We have increased your salaries, but we will not stop there. We will increase it again as soon as we have the opportunity," the head of state noted. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qishki-tatil-chozilishi-mumkinmi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
