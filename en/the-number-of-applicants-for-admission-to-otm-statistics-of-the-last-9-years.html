These numbers clearly show the changes in interest and the number of participants in the OTM entrance exams.</p> <h3>📊 How many applicants applied each year?</h3> <h4>2024</h4> <ul> <li><strong>894,279</strong> - The decrease in recent years did not reach 1 million.</li> </ul> <h4>Year 2023</h4> <ul> <li><strong>1,018,000</strong> – Crossed the 1 million mark again.</li> </ul> <h4>Year 2022</h4> <ul> <li><strong>1,214,232</strong> – High number, year of strong demand.</li> </ul> <h4>Year 2021</h4> <ul> <li><strong>948,000 people</strong> – Post-pandemic stability period.</li> </ul> <h4>Year 2020</h4> <ul> <li><strong>1,484,085 people</strong> – <strong>Record figure!</strong> Interest in OTM is at its peak.</li> </ul> <h4>2019</h4> <ul> <li><strong>1,066,925</strong> – The beginning of the first million years.</li> </ul> <h4>2018</h4> <ul> <li><strong>675,049</strong> – The beginning of the growth period.</li> </ul> <h4>2017</h4> <ul> <li><strong>729,950</strong> – In the period of stability.</li> </ul> <h4>2016</h4> <ul> <li><strong>663,304</strong> – Still far below the million numbers.</li> </ul> <h2>What will happen in 2025?</h2> <p>In 2024, the number of applicants will be 1 million not enough, but can this number increase again in 2025? Factors such as demographic growth, interest in studying abroad, educational reforms, and the number of grants can affect it.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Based on the data of the last 9 years, although the number of applicants reached the highest point in 2020, there was a decrease in the following years. In 2025, this trend may change again. The admission policy, test systems and benefits of higher education institutions have a direct impact on these numbers. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/germaniya-bakalavr-va-magistratura-bosqichlarida-talim-olish-uchun-50-lik-grant-dasturi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p>
