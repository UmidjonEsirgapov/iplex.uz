Let's list these reasons one by one below:</p> <p>1. Not knowing English well;<br/>2. Low GRE score;<br/>3. Low TOEFL/IELTS score;<br/>4. Low academic performance; <br/>5.

Forged documents (forgery of financial and bank documents, grades, diplomas and scores);<br/>9. Self-doubt;<br/>10. Trying to cheat in an interview.</p> <p>So, the main reason for not getting a visa is not knowing English well. This does not apply to students who are going to study the language.
