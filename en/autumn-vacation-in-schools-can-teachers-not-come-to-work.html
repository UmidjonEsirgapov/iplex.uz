                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Question: Are school teachers required to come to work during the autumn vacation or can they go on vacation?</strong><br/><strong>Answer: According to Article 114 of the current Labor Code, employees must perform their work duties at the time specified in accordance with their work schedule or employment contract. condition.</strong><br/><strong>Working hours of pedagogic employees are determined according to the pedagogic workload they have to perform.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Are school teachers required to come to work during the autumn vacation or can they go on vacation?</p> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> According to Article 114 of the current Labor Code, employees at the time specified in their work schedule or employment contract must perform their labor duties.</p> <p>According to Article 125 of the Labor Code, the employer is obliged to fully and accurately take into account the working time of each employee. <strong>Working hours of pedagogic employees are determined according to the pedagogical workload that they have to perform.</strong> Teachers' fulfillment of pedagogical workload is recorded in the daily attendance and departure log and reflected in the monthly working time accounting table.</p> <p><strong>During the periods when there are no classes,</strong> teachers must participate in other pedagogical workload or perform tasks set by the school administration. <strong>According to Article 154 of the Labor Code, the employee receives a salary only for the work actually performed; and for the work he did not perform, he will not be paid.</strong></p> <p>Such cases are formalized in accordance with the law, in agreement with the trade union of the educational institution. If the teacher does not come to work, he will not be included in the notice and will not be paid. If the internal rules of the school indicate that tardiness or absence from work is a violation of labor duties, this situation may be grounds for terminating the employment contract with the teacher.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The absence of classes during the autumn vacation does not give teachers the right to not come to work. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qaysi-chet-tili-sertifikatlari-bilan-imtihon-topshirmasdan-maksimal-ball-olish-mumkin" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
