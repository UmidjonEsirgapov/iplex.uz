                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The Minister of Higher and Secondary Special Education Inomjon Majidov provided information on the procedure for conducting professional and creative exams. </strong><br/><strong>Because their information should be added to the test results.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>The Minister of Higher and Secondary Special Education Inomjon Majidov provided information on the procedure for conducting professional and creative exams.  <p>"Professional-creative exams are proposed to be completed <strong>by July 28</strong> in addition to the test exams. Because their information should be added to the test results.</p> <p>Exams for courses that only take the professional-creative exam (for which there is no test) will be held from July 25 to August 20.</p> <p>Applicants who will take the creative exam are asked to clearly indicate their phone numbers and address information when applying. Because information about the exam dates will be communicated with them. Also, the applicants themselves will have to monitor the website of the higher educational institution", the minister's words are quoted by the Kun.uz reporter.</p> <p>It is noted that the demand for the formation of the composition of the admission commissions of creative exams is being strengthened. In particular, the commission includes not only pedagogical experts, but also representatives of this creative field, creators and representatives of organizations related to the field. The photographed material will be kept and used in the event of an appeal," Inomjon Majidov noted. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/2025-yilgi-kirish-imtihoni-uchun-tolov-qancha-boladi-rasman-malum-qilindi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.</h4>
