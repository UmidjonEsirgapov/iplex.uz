                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Is higher education absolutely free in Germany?</strong><br/><strong>However, students are required to pay a semester fee.</strong><br/><strong>Technische Universität München, which offers such a bachelor's course today, and the application procedure for the bachelor's degree it offers let's talk.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Purpose of the post:</strong></p> <p>Through this post, we will consider one of the <strong>bachelor</strong> courses taught in English for free at the <strong>Technische Universität München</strong> in Germany and the application process.</p> <p><strong>Higher education in Germany </strong><strong>absolutely</strong><strong> is it free?</strong></p> <p>As we all know, Germany is one of the few countries where higher education is free for national and international students. In addition, it is considered one of the most developed countries in the world. It is natural for any person to have the desire to study in Germany at least once. Now the question arises, "Is education in Germany really completely free?" <u><strong>The answer is "Yes and No".</strong></u> I will try to give a full explanation below for the answer.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong></p> <p>Most universities in Germany (national and government funded) do not charge students a tuition fee. But students are required to pay the semester fee. The cost of the semester fee may vary from one university to another, but in most universities the amount of this fee does not exceed 250 euros per semester. We can say that education in Germany is free because it is not a big amount and this fee is charged for administrative work done by the university for the student. But not all universities in Germany are absolutely free. As an example, we can take universities in cities that are part of the German <strong>Baden-Wurttemberg</strong> region. These universities have started demanding tuition fees from international students for some courses from the 2017/18 academic year. That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany. But education in most universities is free, as we said above.</p> <p><strong>Education in Germany through English:</strong></p> <p>As in many developed countries, German universities offer courses taught in English. But the number of such courses for a bachelor's degree is significantly less than for a master's degree. But this does not mean that it does not exist at all. Today we will talk about the <strong>Technische Universität München</strong>, which offers such a bachelor's course, and the procedure for sending documents for the bachelor's course it offers.</p> <p><strong>Technische Universität München in brief:</strong></p> <p>Technische Universität München (abbreviated as TUM or TU München) (German: Technische Universität München) is a public research university in Munich, with additional offices in Garching, Freising, Heilbronn and Singapore. has campuses. This technical university specializes in engineering, technology, medicine and applied and natural sciences. <strong>#41 in the ranking of world universities provided by <strong>THE</strong> (Times Higher Education).</strong></p> <p><strong><img alt="See the source image" src="https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02987/Munich_TUM_A8KJBR_2987571k.jpg"/></strong></p> <p><strong>Proposed course:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Bachelor’s in Management &amp; Technology (BSc) (<strong>details</strong>)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Curriculum language:</strong></p> <ul> <li>English</li> </ul> <p><strong>Duration:</strong></p> <ul> <li>6 semesters (3 years)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Curriculum fee:</strong></p> <ul> <li>In this course tuition is free</li> </ul> <p><strong>Application dates:</strong></p> <p>Admission for international students <strong>opened on February 2022 and is still ongoing.</strong></p> <p><strong>Requirements for candidates:</strong></p> <ol> <li>For almost all German universities, applicants must have a bachelor’s degree or a first stage of a bachelor’s degree <u>(if the candidate university requires an extract from the rating grades on completion of the second stage of the bachelor's degree <u>(if the candidate completed college before entering the university)</u>. <strong>The same is required for this course;</strong></u></li> <li>English language certificate: (one of the following);</li> </ol> <p><strong>Required documents:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Extract of diploma or first/second year ranking grades (in case of translation);</li> <li>Completed university application form;</li> <li>Motivation letter (2 pages A4 format);</li> <li>Certificate of language proficiency - <strong>details here.</strong></li> </ol> <p><strong>To apply for this program offered by TUM </strong>, you are required to register online via <strong>this link</strong>.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>More details here</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/olimpiada-goliblari-va-yosh-olimlar-uchun-pul-mukofotlari-oshiriladi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education..
