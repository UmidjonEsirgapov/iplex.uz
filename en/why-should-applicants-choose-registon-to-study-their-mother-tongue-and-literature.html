                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Pre-school education, school education, higher education, post-higher education, etc. The reason why I am in the education project "Registon" is that, first of all, I found happiness here. why should he choose "Registon"?</strong><br/><strong>Today, the books published by "Regbooks" publishing house are used not only by our students-teachers, but also by applicants and tutors throughout the republic.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Daniyor Teshayev - the leader of the teachers working in the entire "Registon" educational project in the field of mother tongue and literature, senior teacher, that is, he works as a "head" and also as a native language and literature specialist at the "Mega" branch of our educational center. According to the requests and suggestions of many people, we talked with the teacher. Please read!</p> <p><strong>- Today, serious attention is paid to the field of education. The conditions of teachers in state educational institutions have improved significantly. Why did you choose the private sector, specifically the "Registon" educational center?</strong></p> <p>- I heard this question from many people. At the beginning, I heard "advice" that you studied so much, got a diploma, got a higher education, and could you work in public schools. You reminded me of these things (laughs)...</p> <p>You know, first of all, it is important for me that a person works where he feels happy. Whether it's a government office or a private sector, whether he's enjoying what he's doing, bless him, give him luck, I'll support that person, I'll always stand by him! The branches of the educational system are increasing day by day. Pre-school education, school education, higher education, post-higher education, etc... The reason why I am in the "Registon" educational project is, first of all, that I found happiness here. I began to enjoy my work, my students had a common goal, they did not come to class just to spend time, seeing their preparation, I felt that I was working on myself and developing personally. In this system, special attention is paid to honesty, imparting real knowledge, and education. There is no doubt that the participant of this project will achieve higher results and goals than expected. In particular, any specialist who sees his career and future in the "Registon" training center will soon enjoy the fruits of his labor. That's why I chose the "Registon" educational project, my only goal is to work effectively in this field, gain the trust of the people, the respect of my students, gain my skills and experience, and achieve high goals! Naturally, teachers are also very good in this field. What do you mainly demand from the native language and literature teachers at "Registon"? </p> <p>- You are right, indeed, the preparation of applicants or the teaching of mother tongue and literature has become a very busy field. Official statistics also show that the number of educational centers in our republic has exceeded ten thousand. Now think about it, almost every one of them has at least 1 or 2 native language and literature teachers. However, this does not mean that all teachers have their own method and pedagogical style. First of all, let the teacher have his own "tactics", method, voice, if necessary, be different from others! I personally demand this from all the native language and literature teachers in the "Registon" educational project.</p> <p>You know, every native language and literature teacher in the "Registon" educational project has a special curriculum. We work according to this plan. We all come together and plan the monthly test, mutual analysis, debates... in advance. Roughly speaking, there will be no test or control work depending on the "mood" of the teacher. Since we work with a plan, we can clearly show the goal to the applicant. Students can imagine with us where they are now and at what point they see themselves in 3-4 months. That is, they feel where they are going and read with confidence in the result. Our teachers do not follow the student to destinations he does not know. That's why I think that it is one of the aspects that distinguish us from others.</p> <p><strong>- Why should an applicant choose "Registon" in order to study his mother tongue and literature? Give a reason so that it really does not exist anywhere else!</strong></p> <p>- I am far from comparing the teachers of the "Registon" educational project with other teachers. Because everyone has their own truth. In response to this question, I would like to talk about the advantages that applicants will have if they study their native language and literature at "Registon". So, the first reason:</p> <ul> <li>Registon educational center fully provides applicants with literature. Gone are the days when students spent their time searching for books from store to store. We have already found a solution to this problem!</li> <li>Today, the books published by "Regbooks" publishing house are used not only by our students-teachers, but also by applicants and tutors throughout the republic. Many experts have already emphasized the advantages of these books, that they are really beneficial! Many tutors are using many of our presentations and subject guides as textbooks. It is no exaggeration to say that we are the latest source of information they are studying. </li> </ul> <p>In addition, online classes of our teachers, recorded with high quality using the latest technologies, are published on our pages in social networks. This is equally popular not only with our students, but also with applicants from all over the republic, those who are interested in mother tongue and literature.</p> <p><strong>- You are a senior teacher of teachers of mother tongue and literature in "Registon". Tell us about the "Registon" family, the environment here, and the level of education of the applicants.</strong></p> <p>- "Registon" is not my office, it is primarily my FAMILY. We are one family with all our teachers-managers and students! Here, everyone is united for the same goal, each of us is close to our hearts. We all consider "Registan" to be ours. We are constantly studying and working towards its development. We have branches in Tashkent and all regional centers. Although the distance is long, our respect and sincerity have always been strong. Twice a year, the "All-Regional Conference" is organized, we all gather, define goals more clearly, brainstorm on new projects, in short, we work only and only for quality!</p> <p>As you know, at the beginning of the academic year, we announced the "Selected" project. We know that achieving a good result depends 70% on the student and the people around him, and 30% on the teacher who taught him. Based on this, we select the smartest among the applicants and deal with them specially. It is traditionally planned to continue every year.</p> <p>Our readers know very well that we have a strong emphasis on a healthy competitive environment. All the young people of "Registon" are educated in a highly intellectual environment. They learn to keep up with each other and acquire knowledge based on healthy competition as a reflex. Such a creative atmosphere created among the applicants can be considered as a special index of the difference of the "Registon" educational project from other educational centers. Because I don't know to what extent it is implemented and regulated in other places...</p> <p><strong>- Let's talk about the textbooks of the "Regbooks" publishing house that you mentioned above. What is the superiority of this literature over other books? There are many manuals for teaching mother tongue and literature. Why are tutors in most regions choosing "Regbooks" books?</strong></p> <p>- "Regbooks" publishing house is considered to be the network with the most significant place and potential in the preparation of high school graduates. It provides branches of our educational center in the republic, as well as all applicants in our country, with necessary, useful, and most importantly, simple and understandable literature, educational programs, and textbooks. There are many people who know us and benefit from our books! Perhaps we would not have achieved this result without the opportunities given to us by the publishing house "Regbooks"...</p> <p>You know, "Regbooks" is a separate topic. Many people are interested in the selection of books to be published here, the team of teachers who prepare literature for publication as authors, the specialists who work hard on the books to make the applicant comfortable, their quick, positive, and efficient work. What I want to say is that "Regbooks" - "Registon" educational project is one of the most beneficial and beneficial projects for the development of education in our country, bringing Uzbekistan's education to the first place in the world. there will be specific recommendations for studying science, special instructions and directions for easy mastering of subjects. There are, of course, effective methods that have been thoroughly tested in my long career to score higher than the mother tongue and literature.</p> <p>First, read the question twice, carefully, to the end. Mother tongue and literature are a game of words, and it's okay to make a mistake even in the simplest question. It is not for nothing that the popular rule among applicants is that reading the question 2-3 times means finding the answer 50% of the time. Unfortunately, the biggest and main mistake of most of our students is not reading the question to the end...</p> <p>Educational centers like ours (I can't give a clear answer about others, such as "Registon") provide applicants with education several times higher than the state educational standards. A simple example is that, in order not to get excited during the exam, we regularly organize psychological trainings, and ensure that our students are mentally and mentally ready for the exam. If they are diligent and actively participate, they will be able to get a lot for themselves.</p> <p>One of the main recommendations is not to rush! Get to the heart of the question, rely on your knowledge, analyze and synthesize the options, and exclude wrong answers. According to the data, an applicant who enters the exam without any preparation at all risks getting 25% correct answers. Our students studied, trained and worked hard! If he doesn't rush at the last minute so that his efforts won't be worth a penny, if he puts his mind in one place and works on the test with a clear goal, he will definitely get a good result.</p> <p>The last recommendation, first develop the questions that are easy and you know the answer clearly. If there are questions from 10 compulsory subjects and 30 specialized subjects in the entrance exam, the applicant should first select the questions that do not consume too much energy and the answers to which he knows clearly. Then you will have more time to think through difficult and ambiguous questions. If you start solving the test with the principle that you will work in turns from the beginning, one question will appear in front of you like a wall, and all nervousness, brain strain, and compression will begin. As a result, it is not out of the question that you will make a mistake even in simple questions that you already know the answer to.</p> <p>Don't try to be the first. Even if you are the last to leave the exam area, go home with a clear result and a high score. Don't waste all of your hard work in one day, trying to be the first in a hurry. Remember, in the exam, not the first who developed the test, but only those who enrolled in the budget will achieve the goal!</p> <p><strong>- Thank you for the meaningful conversation!</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/magistratura-talabasi-bolgan-qizlarning-kontrakti-davlat-tomonidan-tolab-beriladi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
