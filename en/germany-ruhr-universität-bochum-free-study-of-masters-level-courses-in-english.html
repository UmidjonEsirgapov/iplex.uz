                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Is higher education absolutely free in Germany?</strong><br/><strong>However, students are required to pay a semester fee.</strong><br/><strong>That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Posting purpose:</strong></p> <p>Through this post, we will review one of the <strong>master</strong> courses taught in English for free at <strong>Ruhr-Universität Bochum</strong> in Germany and the application process.</p> <p><strong>Is higher education in Germany </strong><strong>absolutely</strong><strong> free?</strong></p> <p>To all of us It is known that Germany is one of the few countries where higher education is free for national and international students. In addition, it is considered one of the most developed countries in the world. It is natural for any person to have the desire to study in Germany at least once. Now the question arises, "Is education in Germany really completely free?" <u><strong>The answer is "Yes and No".</strong></u> I will try to give a full explanation below for the answer.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong></p> <p>Most universities in Germany (national and government funded) do not charge students a tuition fee. But students are required to pay the semester fee. The cost of the semester fee may vary from one university to another, but in most universities the amount of this fee does not exceed 250 euros per semester. We can say that education in Germany is free because it is not a big amount and this fee is charged for administrative work done by the university for the student. But not all universities in Germany are absolutely free. As an example, we can take universities in cities that are part of the German <strong>Baden-Wurttemberg</strong> region. These universities have started demanding tuition fees from international students for some courses from the 2017/18 academic year. That is why we cannot say that higher education is absolutely free in all regions of Germany. But education in most universities is free, as we said above.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Education in Germany through English:</strong></p> <p>As in many developed countries, German universities offer courses taught in English. Although the number of such courses for the bachelor's degree is significantly less than for the master's level, this does not mean that there are none at all. Today we will talk about Ruhr-Universität Bochum, which offers such a master's course, and the procedure for sending documents for one of the master's courses it offers. Briefly about Ruhr-Universität Bochum: Ruhr-Universität Bochum (RUB), located in Bochum, is one of the ten largest universities in Germany with 42,599 students. RUB was founded in 1962 as the first foundation university in the Federal Republic of Germany. The university is established as a campus in Kerenburg outside the city, and almost all faculty buildings are located on the territory of the university. The university ranks <strong>#251-300</strong> in the ranking of world universities published by <strong>THE</strong> (Times Higher Education).</p> <p><img alt="See the source image" src="https://news.rub.de/sites/default/files/styles/nepo_teaser/public/2018_09_20_luftbild_rub_ausschnitt-6_km.jpg?itok=qE_KTPnH"/></p> <p><strong>Offered course:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Master Cognitive Science (MSc)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Curriculum Language:</strong></p> <ul> <li>English Language</li> </ul> <p><strong>Duration:</strong></p> <ul> <li>4 semesters</li> </ul> <p><strong>Study program fee:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Studying in these courses is free</li> </ul> <p><strong>Dates for submitting documents:</strong></p> <p>At the same time the application period for the winter semester of the university has not yet been opened.
