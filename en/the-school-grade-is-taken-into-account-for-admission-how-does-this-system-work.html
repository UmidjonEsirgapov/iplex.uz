                Useful information for entrants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Kun.uz was informed by the Education and Qualifications Assessment Agency that they are working in cooperation with relevant ministries and agencies on the subject of taking into account the grades of graduates for admission. will it be given?</strong><br/><strong>Which organization will be responsible for entering their average grade into the electronic platform?</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>Starting from this year's admission, the last 6 years' grades of school and secondary special institutions graduates will be taken into account in the entrance exams. 5 points will be added to the score obtained in the entrance exam for a student who studied at "5", and 3 points will be added to a graduate who studied at "3". But what about those who graduated from school in previous years? Will points be added to them?</h4> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/z8rHO1IRQKji5VZaBnoCJ9gaqJy4YYTC.jpg"/>Photo: KUN.UZ</p> <p>Starting with this year's admission, the average of the grades of the school graduates in the last 6 years will be added to the points scored in the entrance exams. That is, the grade of a graduate at school helps him to get into school.</p> <p><strong>What is the procedure?</strong></p> <p>According to the relevant regulations, when calculating the average indicator of the grade of graduates, the total sum of annual grades in grades 6-11 is taken as a ratio of the total sum of the number of subjects taught in each grade.</p> <p>That is, excellent if the graduate scored more than 86%, 5 points will be added to him in the entrance exams, and 3 points will be added to the applicant who studied with unsatisfactory grades. The difference between their scores is not big.</p> <p>Every year by June 15, ministries and organizations with educational institutions prepare 6-year evaluations of graduates and enter them into the interdepartmental integration platform of the "Electronic Government" system. The grades entered into the platform are fixed and cannot be changed.</p> <p>Schools and secondary special education organizations (college, lyceum) calculate the grades of their graduates and enter them into the electronic platform by June 15. The relevant regulations also contain formulas for how grades are calculated.</p> <p>Heads of regional education administrations are personally responsible for the accuracy of the entered data.</p> <p><strong>Obligation of the applicant</strong></p> <p>The average of the applicant's diploma or certificate when registering online for admission to the OTM the grade indicator will appear.</p> <p>The applicant compares this grade with the grade on the diploma or certificate in his hand, and if everything is correct, he presses the confirmation button. He will not be allowed to participate in the exam until the confirmation button is pressed.</p> <p><strong>What if there is a mistake in the grade?</strong></p> <p>If the average grade that the applicant must confirm on the platform and the grade on the diploma or certificate differs, he/she should contact the relevant regional department (for example, if he/she studies at a school, the regional department of the Ministry of School and Preschool Education, secondary if he is in a special educational organization, he will apply to the relevant department). Regional administrations correct the assessment and the applicant approves it. After confirmation, the applicant is responsible for his/her grade.</p> <p>If the applicant's grade is not included in the electronic platform, the Knowledge and Skills Assessment Agency (called DTM in the Regulations, but now the Knowledge and Skills Assessment Agency is established on the basis of the organization) will send a request to the relevant organization to enter the applicant's grade, and the grade will be entered.</p> <p>If the applicant studied if the educational institution is closed or reorganized, then the average indicator of the graduates' grades (if necessary, taken from the archive) is entered into the platform of the Agency for the Evaluation of Knowledge and Skills by the relevant regional administration based on the original of the document. we have the right to ask how accurately it is being processed so that it does not cause problems in submitting documents and calculating points.</p> <p>The contingent of applicants who apply to OTM is not small. In last year's admission, 1.2 million applicants applied to OTM. 395,023 of them are graduates, and the remaining 819,209 were graduates of previous years.</p> <p>According to the Ministry of School and Pre-School Education, more than 390,000 graduates will graduate from schools this year. If the Ministry provides their information, even if approximately 10 thousand or more graduates will graduate from secondary special, private or other schools, another 800 thousand applicants who have completed their studies in previous years can also apply to OTM. is being processed. It was agreed with the organizations about the need to enter the grades into the electronic platform without delay.</p> <p>However, there are still questions.</p> <p><strong>Firstly,</strong> will points be added to the applicants who graduated from schools and special secondary institutions in previous years? Which organization will be responsible for entering their grade point average into the electronic platform? Why is the statute not clear about this? Have they not been forgotten?</p> <p>According to the information provided by the Agency for Assessment of Knowledge and Skills, work is currently being carried out on the same issue, and additional information will be provided. <p>In addition to this, according to the regulation, if the applicant notices a difference between the grade entered on the electronic platform and the grade on the certificate or diploma, it is said that he should go to the regional education department and correct his grade. Should the students who live in the remote villages, far from the district center, have to search for the administration if they find themselves in such a situation?</p> <p>In addition, we believe that it is necessary to inform the graduates about the new procedure and how to solve it if they have a problem situation. There are only 2 months left until the start of admissions to higher education institutions.</p> <p><strong>Zilola Gaybullayeva, Kun.uz reporter</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/litseylarning-bitiruvchilari-milliy-sertifikat-olish-korsatkichi-2-barobarga-oshdi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education..</p>
