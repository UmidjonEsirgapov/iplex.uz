That is, they see a difference between the quotas approved by the State Admissions Commission and the quotas on the mandat.uzbmb.uz website and are surprised. Looking at the numbers in the TOTAL column. But in this table, the quotas are also divided by languages.</p> <p>For example, in the picture above, TOTAL 215 quotas are allocated for the "Industrial Pharmacy" direction. But 165 of these quotas are for the 🇺🇿Uzbek group, 50 are for the 🇷🇺Russian group.</p> <p>In such cases, applicants who do not pay attention to the language section are lost. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kirish-imtihonlari-televideniye-orqali-ham-translatsiya-qilinadi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
