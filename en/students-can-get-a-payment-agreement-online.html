                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Those recommended for studentship do not need to go to a higher education institution for a payment contract.</strong><br/><strong>This can be done online through a special portal.</strong><br/><strong>The term and amount of super-contract payment is determined by the State Admissions Commission (for the first half of the academic year), the rest part is determined by the management of higher educational institution. This can be done online through a special portal. <p>All students, including students recommended for the first year, can receive contracts online from the first day of the new academic year.</p> <p>For this, registration is required on a special electronic portal of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation. It is also possible to submit an application for a "super-contract" and draw up a contract through this portal.</p> <p>According to the law, students are also given the opportunity to pay the contract fee in installments:</p> <p>Including:</p> <p>- at least 25% of the contract for the first courses until September 15 (or until the deadline set by the State Admissions Commission) and the second and subsequent courses until October 1 (or extended by the management of the Higher Education Institution until the deadline);</p> <p>- at least 50 percent of the contract until January 1, 75 percent until April 1, and 100 percent until July 1 (or until the deadlines extended by the management of the higher education institution);</p> <p>- foreign citizens until the deadlines set by the management of the higher education institution.</p> <p>The term and amounts of the super-contract payment are determined by the State Admissions Commission (for the first half of the academic year), the rest by the management of the higher education institution will be determined. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/shanxay-hukumati-stipendiyasi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.</strong>
