                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>In the presentation, the following was proposed regarding the processes of admission to universities: 1. the minimum passing score for admission to study has been increased in 2 steps, for healthcare, law, business and management fields - 94.5 points, for other fields - 75.6 points (in practice for all directions - 56.7 points); 2. the state grant is allocated for students in the form of an educational grant and a social-stimulating grant.</strong><br/><strong>In this case: an educational grant is allocated to students for one academic year and is allocated to students who have scored the highest points according to the results of enrollment in the 1st year and from the 2nd year according to the rating indicators; social-incentive grant - awarded to students admitted on the basis of targeted admission and preferential treatment for the entire study period; the obligation of students who studied on the basis of an educational grant to work for 3 years after graduation is canceled; 3. quotas for part-time education should not exceed the quota allocated for full-time education.</strong><br/><strong>As mentioned, the part-time education will be phased out by gradually expanding the form of distance education and introducing the extended form of education. the minimum passing score for admission is increased in 2 stages and is set to 94.5 points for healthcare, law, business and management courses, and 75.6 points for other courses (practically for all courses - 56.7 points); <p>2. the state grant is allocated in the form of an educational grant and a social-stimulating grant for students. In this case:</p> <ul> <li><em>educational grant - allocated to students for one academic year and allocated to students who have scored the highest points according to the results of admission in the 1st year, starting from the 2nd year according to rating indicators; <li><em>the obligation of students who studied on the basis of an educational grant to work for 3 years after graduation is canceled;</em></li> </em></li></ul> <p>3.
