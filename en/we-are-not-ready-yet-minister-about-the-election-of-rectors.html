                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>We can do this when public control is well established," he said. To the journalist's clarifying question about the exact time of electing rectors, Sharipov replied that "it takes time." there will be an academic council, and it will be right if [rectors] are elected by them," said the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation.</strong><br/><strong>Kongirotboy to Sharipov: "Why are non-state HEIs not being given licenses for jurisprudence, is there some kind of artificial barrier?" The question was also asked.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>The Minister of Higher Education Kungirotboy Sharipov answered the reporter's question about his personal opinion on the issue of the election of rectors: "Now, I think we are not ready. We need time for this. You know, we have our own mentality. We can do it when public control is well established."</h4> <p>Is there no plan to elect rectors in higher education institutions, is this not being considered? The reporter of Kun.uz addressed this question to the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation Kungirotboy Sharipov. The issue of electing rectors is included in the "Uzbekistan-2030" strategy. It has not yet been decided. If such a decision is made, of course, in most countries, the rectors will be elected for 5 years, the minister replied. <blockquote> <p>"Now, right now, I don't think we are ready. It takes time. You know, we have our own mentality. We can do it when public control is well established," he said.</p> </blockquote> <p>To the journalist's clarifying question about the exact time of electing the rectors, Sharipov answered again that "time is needed."</p> <blockquote> <p>"We should work in this way, for example, if we do our work as we wish, our system will improve if we perform the tasks set before us with quality. At this moment, the day we achieve this will be their public council or scientific council, and it will be right if [rectors] are elected by them," said the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kongirotboy To Sharipov: "Why are non-state higher education institutions not granted a license for the field of jurisprudence, is there some kind of artificial barrier?" the question was also asked. Sharipov said that there is an artificial barrier here.</p> <blockquote> <p>"There is a high demand for the field of jurisprudence. The Ministry of Justice will allow the OTM that meets this.</p> <p>Now we say that the quality of education has greatly decreased, but we also say why not everyone is allowed. Training a lawyer is a very complicated process. That is why the demand is provided by the employing organization. There is no confidence at the moment, so that's why </p> <p>Now is a transitional period. If there is confidence in this educational institution, I think that it will be allowed by the Ministry of Justice," said Kungirotboy Sharipov. <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz website. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsga-kelmagan-akademik-qarzdor-talabaning-kursdan-qoldirilish-tartibi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p></blockquote></p>
