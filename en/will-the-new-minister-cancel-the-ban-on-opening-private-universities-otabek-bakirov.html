                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Licenses for private universities have been suspended for 9 months based on a verbal order.</strong><br/><strong>To this day, more than a hundred investors in the movement to open a private university do not know what to do.</strong><br/><strong>Millions of dollars in land, buildings, equipment. sewn.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Licenses for private universities have been suspended for 9 months based on oral assignments. To date, more than a hundred investors in the movement to open a private university do not know what to do. Millions of dollars have been invested in land, buildings and equipment. Scientists, professors, researchers were invited.</p> <p>The most interesting thing is that after the administrative suspension of licensing, a black market for licenses appeared. Licenses issued in 2022 cost several million dollars. I am far from saying that a group of officials and their possible accomplices deliberately did this to earn millions of dollars by suspending the licensing, but the bottom line is that today the only way to open a private university is to break the law and become complicit in someone's corrupt actions.</p> <p>I do not know whether the Head of State was informed about this or not. But I officially hope that Odil Abdurahmanov, who was transferred from the Administration to the post of Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, will start his activity in the system by ending this artificially organized pest. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oliygoh/qoraqalpoq-davlat-universiteti" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p>
