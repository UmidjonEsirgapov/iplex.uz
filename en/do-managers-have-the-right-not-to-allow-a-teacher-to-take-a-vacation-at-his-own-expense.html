However, the procedure for this is defined in the labor legislation. According to Article 241 of the Labor Code, an employee can be granted a leave without pay based on a written application, the duration of which is determined by agreement between the employee and the employer. However, it should not exceed <strong>three months</strong> continuously or cumulatively during the calendar year from the date of the last unpaid leave.</p> <p>Accordingly, the employee may <strong>take leave at his own expense.</strong></p> <p>However, in order to take this leave, <strong>he must agree with the employer</strong>. If an agreement is not reached, the employee will not be able to take this leave.</p> <p>However, if the employee belongs to the category of persons specified in Article 242 of the Civil Code, he has the right to use this right even without the consent of the employer. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/1/1-sinf-jismoniy-tarbiya" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p>
