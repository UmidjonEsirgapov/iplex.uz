                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Only one aspect, if there are those who have completed the 9th grade, they will submit the document with a college diploma, if they have completed the 11th grade, they will submit it with a school certificate; Those who are studying in vocational college and technical school. Today, those who are studying in a professional educational organization can easily apply, even though they have not yet finished their studies.</strong><br/><strong>Only as I said above, they apply with the 11th grade certificate; Students studying in higher education.</strong><br/><strong>Persons who have already received higher education can easily apply again for the bachelor's degree.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Who can apply as an applicant?</strong></p> <p>Legal blogger Khushnudbek answered this question: the following can apply for the stage:</p> <p><strong>those who have completed the 11th grade of general secondary education.</strong></p> <p>This includes all schools, including presidential and creative schools, specialized and military schools, lyceums, gymnasiums, vocational schools, and so on. The most important thing is to have a certificate based on the 11th grade, it is not possible to study as a student after completing the 10th grade;</p> <p><strong>Those who graduated from a professional and secondary special education organization.</strong></p> <p>This includes academic lyceums, vocational colleges and technical schools. There is only one aspect, if there are those who have completed the 9th grade, they submit the document with a college diploma, if they have completed the 11th grade, they submit it with a school certificate; however, he can easily submit documents. Only as I said above, they submit with the 11th grade certificate;</p> <p><strong>Students studying in higher education.</strong></p> <p>This includes those who are currently studying in public or non-state higher education institutions in Uzbekistan, as well as abroad, in schools, lyceums, colleges, etc. they can apply for studies with their diplomas. In case of enrollment, he chooses where he will study, if he wants to continue his current studentship, if he wants, he can study in the new place he entered. But please, don't apply just for the sake of the game, because if you enter and then drop out, you will have reserved one applicant's place in vain, and then no one will be accepted for the vacant place. they can apply for the bachelor's degree. They are just like today's students in school, high school, college, etc. they apply for studies with their diplomas, not with a university diploma. Another aspect here is that according to the current legislation, those who have received higher education once (regardless of whether they studied on a grant or contract) become a student for the second time only on the basis of a fee-contract. That is, they cannot apply for a grant, and even if they do, they will only study under a contract.</p> <p>So, the above 5 categories of people can easily apply as an applicant through the my.uzbmb.uz website. Good luck to everyone! — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/til-sertifikatisiz-chet-tili-yonalishlariga-topshirish-mumkin-emas" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: prepared based on the information of the oliygoh.uz site.
