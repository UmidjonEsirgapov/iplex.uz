If entrance exams are waived, applicants are admitted to OTM based on the results of school exams. </strong></p> <p>The head of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports, Farhod Mirzayev, said that in the future, it is planned to cancel the entrance exams for higher education institutions, and there will be no entrance exams, as in the experience of foreign higher education institutions, to be implemented gradually in Uzbekistan. After that, some applicants will not participate and may be released directly. Then, after receiving a high score in the exam, the question of unification was raised, not admission to the OTM. The decision on unification has been submitted to the relevant body. If this is approved, we will abandon the entrance exams and gradually start admitting children to higher education institutions at the expense of school-based exams. For example, four regions will be selected and the issue of holding in these regions will be considered at the first stage. Later, it will be implemented in the rest of the regions as well," said Farhod Mirzayev.</p> <p>Also, Farhod Mirzayev announced that it was agreed to hold the entrance tests for higher education institutions for the 2021-22 academic year in <strong>2 scenarios</strong> - indoor and outdoor. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/cv-ozi-nima-va-nima-uchun-kerak-yoxud-cv-tayyorlashning-oson-usullari" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <div class="inpage-ad" id="adfox_157805472798843542_container"> </div> is expected.
