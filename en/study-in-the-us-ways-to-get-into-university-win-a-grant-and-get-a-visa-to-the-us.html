But Jasur Ziyautdinov, the hero of our next article about "Education Abroad", shared his advice. He is 26 years old. He successfully graduated from Westminster International University in 2020. In the same year, he founded Worldwide Consulting, a consulting agency in the field of education abroad. In 2022, he was accepted to six US law schools and won grants totaling $170,506. In 2023, he successfully completed his master's degree (LL.M) at the University of Georgia Law School, USA. Currently, he is actively working on creating a start-up in the field of immigration and education abroad.</p> <p>Zasur shared information about entering a university, winning a grant and obtaining a visa to the USA.</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/6/1100__m3UymTgP6ERVRVLC_JxVGCiCGXrpAjc8.png"/></p> <p><b>What USA?</b></p> <p>Before choosing to study in the USA, I considered two other countries, Canada and England. After visiting all three countries, what I liked most was the diversity of the climate and natural landscape in the United States. In addition, I participated in the US Work and Travel program twice, which allowed me to better understand the country's culture, people and traditions. There are more than 4,000 universities in the United States. My university is one of the TOP 20 universities in the field of law and the first public university in the country. In addition to these reasons, I chose this university because Terry Simmons, a professor and immigration lawyer, a well-known expert in this field, taught at this university. it starts one year before the start of studies. Many prestigious universities accept students in the fall each year, with applications closing in the fall/winter months. In other cases, universities accept applications in three different seasons: fall, winter, and spring. It should be noted that there are low-level private institutions that rarely provide funds for students and accept students throughout the year, because the academic process there can start four or three times a year.</p> <p>The duration of educational programs in the United States varies by degree and specialization. A bachelor's degree usually takes four years, a master's degree takes one or two years, and a doctoral degree can take four to eight years. In some specialties, it is possible to enter a doctorate immediately after receiving a bachelor's degree.</p> <p>Study in fields such as law and medicine requires a longer period of time. For example, after an undergraduate degree, one must take the MCAT and attend medical school for four years, followed by three to seven years of internship at a local hospital, depending on the specialty.</p> <p>To become a lawyer, you must complete a bachelor's degree in any field and then take the LSAT in logic and language. Law school usually lasts three years. However, if you have earned a law degree in another country and are eligible for a law license after your bachelor's degree, you may be able to complete your law degree and become licensed to practice law in the United States within a year.</p> <p>If you are applying to graduate school, the Common App, which allows you to apply to various universities, can be a useful tool. English language proficiency level must be at least B2 (IELTS 6). Many universities also accept Duolingo/TOEFL certificates as proof of English language proficiency.</p> <p>Universities usually require an English score of at least 6.5 (IELTS), sometimes 7, for admission to master's and doctoral programs. English proficiency is an important criterion for selecting candidates.</p> <p>Participating in offline seminars and online seminars organized by universities can also increase your chances of admission. Many universities offer an application fee waiver to the participants of such events.</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/u/s/65e6b1d121517.png"/></p> <p>The documents submitted for bachelor's and master's degrees are basically the same:</p> <p>High school certificate with grades/bachelor's degree diploma</p> <p>IELTS, TOEFL or Duolingo certificate</p> <p>SAT/GRE/GMAT certificate</p> <p>Motivation letter</p> <p>Resume</p> <p>Letters of recommendation</p> <p>Many universities also require a diploma evaluation, which can be evaluated for an average of $200 through certified online organizations such as naces.org.</p> <p><b> </b></p> <p><b> <img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/6/1100__mXK_VQsByZvPJGwBgzne70_BWkzL-Er8.png"/></b></p> <p><b>Funding:</b></p> <p>In order to receive maximum funding from the university, you must be one of the best candidates who applied to this university. It is important to learn as much as possible about a particular university, its traditions, values ​​and culture. Your resume and essay should reflect these values. Remember that you have to write a separate essay for each university. Early filing also increases your chances of funding. However, good academic performance and high scores in IELTS/SAT/GMAT/GRE are important. In addition, you should have a quality that sets you apart from other candidates in addition to your academic performance. This can be participation in projects, volunteering, internships, etc. You should not only rely on university funding, but also seek external sources of funding.</p> <p><b>U.S. visa process:</b></p> <p>Once you receive your acceptance letter from the university, you will be required to provide proof of funds to cover the costs of your studies and subsequent living in the United States. This is necessary for the university to provide you with an I-20 that confirms your student status for the entire period of study in the United States. To obtain this document, you will need to schedule an interview at the US Embassy and fill out a DS-160 form. It is important to keep the completed application form as you will need it for future visa applications. Citizens of Uzbekistan are usually issued a one-year visa. When interviewing at the embassy, ​​you must answer the visa officer's questions honestly and clearly. It is important to be clear and as confident as possible about your reasons for choosing a particular university and country, your plans after graduation, and how you will pay for your studies. If you have experience in obtaining visas for other countries, your chances of getting a visa will increase. At the same time, previous refusal of a US visa or deportation will negatively affect the possibility of obtaining a visa now. Although the number of subjects was not so large, the number of tasks was sufficient. In America, a student must come to class prepared, that is, he must read at least 30-40 pages in advance on the given topic. There is usually one teacher for each subject, and the lesson consists of lectures and seminars. Active discussions can be held between students and the teacher, students can ask questions, and the professor can ask students questions about the topic. During the lesson, all students actively record everything the teacher says. During most exams, teachers allow students to bring their notes. One of my life tricks to get good grades was to write down what the teacher said during the lecture on the exam. In America, no one checks your slips or watches you during the exam. This is because if someone cheats, they first realize that they cheated themselves. You will be evaluated not only during the exam, but also during your studies, during each lecture. How many times you came prepared, how many times you asked questions, how many times you turned to the teacher with additional questions, and how many times you wrote to him by e-mail are counted. All of these are taken into account when evaluating you as a student.</p> <p>The American education system does not envisage that students help each other in their studies, instead it is based on the individual responsibility of each student. Instead of supporting each other, students can sometimes even report those trying to cheat in exams. This is because students are graded against each other. Even if all students pass the exams without mistakes, the professor can only give a certain number of high marks. He will have to choose the best of the best.</p> <p>Grades have a big impact on getting a job. At our law school, powerful law firms have asked the university for a list of the top 10% of students in terms of academic performance and offered them jobs before graduation.<b></b></p> <p><b>Work while studying:</b></p> <p>Foreign students can work up to 20 hours while studying. The job must be on campus or the university allows off-campus work. Our students could get a job as a bus driver and earn $15 an hour. Many students worked in kitchens for $12.50 an hour. The advantage of this job was that a free lunch was served in the cafeteria. For master's students and doctoral students, the university offered them positions as associate professors, librarians, or other positions in university administration. There is also a CPT program where a student can do an internship in their field instead of studying. At our university, master's and doctoral students mostly lived in $600 rooms. Undergraduate students lived in double rooms. The price of such housing was twice as cheap. Students also had the option of finding independent housing off-campus or living in housing owned by student organizations such as sororities and fraternities. This time period is called OPT (Optional Practice Training). Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) majors can extend their OPT for up to 3 years. After graduation, the student must find a place to work in his field. It is not necessary to be paid, but it should be at least twenty hours a week.</p> <p><em><strong>Ja'farkhan Isakhanov</strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>Chief Editor of the Aliygoh.uz educational platform</strong></em> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qoqonda-yangi-universitet-tashkil-etiladi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources..
