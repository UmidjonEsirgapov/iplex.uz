The authority to extend the initial payment period for 1st-year students is given to the <strong>State Admissions Commission</strong>, and for the rest of the stages, the <strong>HET Rector</strong> makes a decision on extending the period.</p> <p>If you send an application through the <strong>kontrakt.edu.uz</strong> website and it is approved, you can pay in 4 parts and get information about the terms. However, this procedure is only recommended for state higher education institutions with financial independence. But super-contract students need to pay 50% first. The 25% rule only applies to regular contracts. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/oliygoh/cyber-university-davlat-universiteti" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>How does this news affect you?
