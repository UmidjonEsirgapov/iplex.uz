The reason is that applicants and students must be able to fully demonstrate their acquired knowledge in the exams. If well-prepared young people fail to demonstrate their knowledge on the main test day without suppressing their excitement, the educational center will take responsibility for them. In order to prevent such situations, monthly trainings are held. In addition, the skills of <strong>perseverance, self-confidence, fighting for a goal</strong> are formed in young people.</p> <p class="iframe-wrapper" dir="auto"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1fpBj31BLm0"></iframe></p> <p dir="auto"><strong>3.
