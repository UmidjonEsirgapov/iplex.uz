                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Fee-contract amounts will not be increased in 2025. According to the officials of the Ministry of Higher Education, fee-contract amounts will not be increased in higher education institutions this academic year.</strong><br/><strong>From a legal point of view, how will it be?</strong><br/><strong>Conclusion: In 2025, the fee-contract sums for students will remain unchanged.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>The fee-contract sums will not be increased in 2025</h2> <p>According to the information given by the officials of the Ministry of Higher Education, the fee-contract sums will not be increased in the current academic year. So, students will continue their studies in the amounts approved last year.</p> <h3>What will happen from a legal point of view?</h3> <p>In the decision of the State Admissions Commission in 2024, there was a sentence: <strong>"Starting from the 2024-2025 academic year, the payment-contract amounts should be approved in the following order"</strong>. Therefore, since the new amounts have not been approved, the amounts set last year will remain in effect.</p> <h3>Issue of universities with financial independence</h3> <p>Higher educational institutions granted financial independence have the right to increase the contract amounts or leave them as they are. But most likely, they will not increase the fee-contract amounts either (there may be only some exceptions).</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>In 2025, the fee-contract amounts for students will remain unchanged. This provides financial comfort for students and parents. Online contracts will be live soon and will reflect the exact amounts approved last year. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/goi-peace-foundation-tomonidan-tashkil-etiladigan-insholar-tanlovi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>How does this news affect you?
