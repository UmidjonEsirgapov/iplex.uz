                The most relevant news in the field of education today is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Does a private university diploma really fail?</strong><br/><strong>Apply in writing. Naturally, in most cases, there is no legal basis for such a statement.</strong><br/><strong>If someone says that "a private diploma does not pass", demand a legal basis and protect your rights. don't forget.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Does a diploma from a private university really not pass?</h2> <p>Many people say <strong>"a diploma from a private university does not pass"</strong>. But before believing such statements, it is necessary to check the legal basis. Below we provide information on how to proceed step by step.</p> <h3>1. Ask an official for a reason</h3> <p>If someone tells you that a private university diploma will not pass, first ask him:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Clarify what law or decision he is talking about,</p> </li> <li> <p>Which normative legal document he is relying on.</p> </li> </ul> <h3>2. Apply in writing</h3> <p>Of course, in most cases there is no legal basis for such a statement. Therefore, you should apply in writing to that manager or responsible person.</p> <p>➡️ According to the law, an answer to your application should be returned <strong>within 15 days</strong>.</p> <h3>3. If there is no answer - the second stage</h3> <p>In most cases, this question is not answered. If there is no legal basis in the given answer, then such a claim is untrue.</p> <h3>4. Request an official letter from the university</h3> <p>Ask your private university to issue an official letter. Through this, you will have a two-way approach to the issue and will have the opportunity to prove it with documents.</p> <h3>5. The right to appeal to the court</h3> <p>If you are not given a reasonable answer despite all the appeals, you can appeal to the court. Because in such a case, the leader is abusing his duty and should be held accountable.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Private universities also operate on the basis of a license issued by the state. Therefore, their diploma also has legal force. If someone says that "private diploma does not pass", demand a legal basis and do not forget to protect your rights. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/buyuk-britaniya-universiteti-stipendiya-dasturiga-arizalar-qabul-qilmoqda" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
