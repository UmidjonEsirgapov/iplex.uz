                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>According to the test results, 193 thousand 421 applicants were recommended for studentship.</strong><br/><strong>I do not want to blame the schools for the main reason for these low scores.</strong><br/><strong>The main reasons why applicants get low scores are studies with the participation of experts, in-depth should be analyzed.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>According to the results of the test, 193 thousand 421 applicants were recommended for studentship. But almost half of the applicants who took the test did not score even 56.7 points. So, what is the reason for the applicants' low scores in the tests?</p> <p>In relation to this question, M. Karimov, Director of the Knowledge and Skills Assessment Agency, stated the following:</p> <p>If the test criteria prepared for higher education institutions are simplified every year, they will be simplified and not improved, - says M. Karimov. - In general, if we look at the dynamics, the passing scores and indicators are decreasing year by year. I don't want to blame schools for the main reason for these low scores. A lot depends on the applicant. During the learning process, we witnessed that most of the applicants start leaving before half an hour before the start of the tests.</p> <p>Applicants who scored 56.7 points in this year's graduates make up more than 30 percent. There is also an assumption that 70.5% of applicants who scored less than 56.7 points graduated in previous years. In previous years, in order to slightly filter the test process, there were cases of improving the tests and increasing the requirements. But in recent years, all questions have been written in a simplified order. The main reasons why applicants get low scores should be studied and deeply analyzed with the participation of experts. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/135-ming-abituriyent-qoshimcha-qabul-doirasida-talabalikka-tavsiya-etildi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
