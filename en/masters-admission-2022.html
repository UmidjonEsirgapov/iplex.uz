                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>For example, if an applicant studied 60 subjects at a higher education institution, the grades obtained from these subjects are added and divided by 60.</strong><br/><strong>Foreign language certificate Applicants without a foreign language certificate apply for master's degree. </strong><br/><strong>A national certificate of no less than B2 level or an international certificate of equivalent level is required for foreign language majors, and for all other majors.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>From 2022, the admission for the master's level of HEIs has been transferred to a new system.</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>How to submit documents?</strong></p> <p>January 1, 2022 From July, the process of online registration of documents for admission to master's specialties of higher educational institutions of the republic began.</p> <p>According to the Ministry of Higher Education, the process of submitting documents for admission to master's specialties of state higher education institutions for the 2022/2023 academic year will be carried out on the official website of the ministry http://magistr.edu.uz until July 30 (also on this day).</p> <p dir="auto">Application submission process<strong> consists of three stages:</strong></p> <ul dir="ltr"> <li>the applicant registers in the system and fills out the application;</li> <li>enters the information of the diploma and foreign language certificate;</li> <li>the admissions committee accepts the application.</li> </ul> <div class="intext_adf" id="native_network650335841537"></div> <p>Starting from the 2022/2023 academic year, the admission to the master's degree is carried out on the basis of the average score of the bachelor's degree and the score of the relevant national or international certificate on the level of knowledge of a foreign language, strictly observing the sequence of scores. An additional exam will not be held.</p> <p>You can see how many applications have been submitted for which direction in the section of HEIs in the statistics section of the magistr.edu.uz site.</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>Selection of applicants: the higher the undergraduate grades and certificate score, the better</strong></p> <div class="intext_adf" id="native_network405867733548"></div> <p dir="auto">After the acceptance of documents, a rating will be made based on the grade point average (GPA) in the application of the bachelor's diploma and the score in the language certificate.</p> <p dir="auto">Zafar Amirkulov, an information service specialist of the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education, explained it as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p dir="auto"><em>"When selecting applicants, points collected in all subjects during 4 years of study at a higher education institution are taken into account. For example, if an applicant studied 60 subjects at a higher education institution, the grades obtained from these subjects are added and divided by 60.</em></p> <p dir="auto"><em>Another aspect that plays an important role in the selection is foreign language. certificate level. Someone may have obtained C1 or C2. These aspects also determine the grant or contract positions of the applicants." majors</em></p> <p dir="auto">The major chosen by the applicants for the master's degree must be the same or similar to the major they studied in the bachelor's degree. For example, an applicant who has completed philology cannot study economics at a master's degree, etc.</p> <p dir="auto">The list of related fields has been published. The list can be downloaded here. Graduates of fields that are not included in this list can study at the master's degree only in the field of bachelor's degree.</p> <p dir="auto">Graduates of foreign and private universities in Uzbekistan can study in suitable (relevant) educational fields.</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>Certificate of foreign language</strong></p> <p dir="auto">Certificate of knowledge of foreign language applicants cannot apply for a master's degree. There is no internal foreign language exam.</p> <p dir="auto">C1 is required for foreign language majors, and a national certificate of at least B2 level or an international certificate of equivalent level is required for all other majors. The most common international certificate - IELs requires at least 7 points in philological fields, and at least 5.5 points in other fields.</p> <p dir="auto">There is a misconception or information that graduates need a language certificate of C1 level because fields such as mother tongue and literature, literary studies are also philological. According to Kun.uz Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education, a B2 certificate is required for such courses. <p>Persons with a national or equivalent international certificate will be able to participate in contests for master's majors and post-higher education majors.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/3/1100__N_5eJVIODjK-ZkUFU8c8Tpf_ZBHSZVPz.jpg"/></p> <p><img alt="" src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/3/1100__N_5eJVIODjK-ZkUFU8c8Tpf_ZBHSZVPz.jpg"/></p> src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/3/1100__XsMMv0rOfGrvkqOR71IQFV9MNlqlW-kc.jpg"/&gt;</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>Admissions will also be held in January</strong></p> <p dir="auto">Now, if the summer admission quotas are not filled, admissions can also be held in January. The documents for this purpose will be accepted in December.</p> <p dir="auto">If the admission quotas are filled in some HEIs, the HEI itself will make an independent decision on additional admissions.</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>Master's degree is free for girls</strong></p> <p dir="auto">From this year, women at all stages of the master's degree were exempted from the payment contract. In this sense, the fact that applicants are below or above the grant line for girls is only symbolic. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/abituriyentlar-imtihonlarga-tayyorlanishda-kop-qiladigan-5-xato" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <div class="main-img"> </div> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
