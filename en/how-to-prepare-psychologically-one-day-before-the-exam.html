                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>The following recommendations will help you prepare: 1.</strong><br/><strong>Get enough sleep First of all, you need to get enough sleep.</strong><br/><strong>Breath exercises will help you overcome excitement and this exercise will also help you on the exam day.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Psychological preparation before the exam is very important. The following recommendations will help you prepare:</p> <h4>1. Sleep well</h4> <p>First of all, you need to sleep well. If a person does not get enough sleep, information will increase due to brain fatigue, and unnecessary information will continue to circulate in the brain. Sleep is necessary for sorting out the necessary information during the exam.</p> <h4>2. Take a walk in nature</h4> <p>An hour walk in nature will help you focus. Before the exam, it is necessary to communicate with as few people as possible and be alone. If you are excited, take a deep breath and let it out. Repeat this 10-15 times. Breathing exercises can help you deal with anxiety, and this exercise will also help on exam day.</p> <h4>3. Note to parents</h4> <p>Trust your child. Tell your child that you are with him in any situation. Even if you don't get in, remember that there are other options and that studying isn't always the ultimate goal in life. The fact that the child feels the support of his parents gives him strength. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/javoblar-varaqasini-togri-boyash-uchun-nimalarga-etibor-qaratish-kerak" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
