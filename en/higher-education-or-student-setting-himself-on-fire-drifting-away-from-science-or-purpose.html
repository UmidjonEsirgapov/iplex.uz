                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>In scientific research, professors and teachers of higher education are engaged in scientific research in their field, looking for scientifically based solutions to the existing problems of their field.</strong><br/><strong>In scientific research, professors and teachers of higher education are scientific in their field. engages in research, seeks scientifically based solutions to the existing problems of his field.</strong><br/><strong>However, what is requested is never delivered.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>The fate of the student who died as a result of self-immolation on February 13 forced many to discuss <strong>problems in the education system</strong> once again. We would like to share the opinions of scientist Bakhtiyor Sheraliyev, who has been conducting scientific research in China for almost 5 years:</p> <p>For the past 4 months, I have been working in one of the higher education institutions in Uzbekistan. Before that, I was engaged in scientific research in China for almost 5 years. At the same time, I have the opportunity to compare the higher education system of China and Uzbekistan from the inside, understand where our problems are, and diagnose them. Because when you're in a quagmire, the more you try, the more you sink into the quagmire. You will never be able to get out of the quagmire yourself unless some external force pulls you out. Our higher education system is currently in this state.</p> <p>I divide the activities of higher education into two parts: scientific research and educational processes. In scientific research, professors and teachers of higher education are engaged in scientific research in their field, looking for scientifically based solutions to the existing problems of their field. In this regard, he publishes articles, participates in various scientific conferences, sorts out information in his field, organizes it into a study guide or textbook, etc. In the course of study, he teaches certain subjects to students in higher education institutions. They will be helped to specialize in a certain specialty in the future. But at the same time, the higher education system is unable to fulfill both of these two functions. Why? Let's take a look at the factors that cause the problem. I write here based on my subjective views. The factors I have listed may differ from the opinions and views of another expert.</p> <p>So, the first factor is that universities have become caravan palaces.

Let's take a look at the factors that cause the problem. I write here based on my subjective views. The factors I have listed may differ from the opinions and views of another expert.</p> <p>So, the first factor is that universities have become caravan palaces. I'll explain more crudely: there is someone who is not working, who can't do anything else, someone who is so-and-so, in short, a thousand kilometers away from science, who can easily get a job at a university. He has so much knowledge and pedagogic skills that all of them are gathered in higher education institutions. If he says yes, "it will go away, in the beginning, everyone will have a hard time, so-and-so." What higher education is the great aunt's house? Why are personnel not selected and hired for higher education. Why is there no system in place? Why can anyone get a job in higher education? He doesn't know his subject thoroughly, he doesn't know any foreign language, he doesn't understand what scientific research is, he can't write or read an article. What are such personnel doing in higher education? We cannot develop higher education in ten or even a hundred years with such an army of idiots. The second biggest factor that bogs down higher education is the overabundance of aimless and useless red tape in higher education. At the same time, higher education institutions, from the management staff to ordinary professors, are so busy that they do not have time to deal with science and the educational process, which is their main function. Every day, the Ministry asks people to fill in some tables. The fashion at the moment is to ask for a list of lab equipment and the like. However, what is asked for is never delivered. Teachers and heads of departments who write lists have already understood that all this is just paperwork. Otherwise, what's the point of asking the same thing every 2-3 weeks? The worst part is that the tables that need to be filled out come with a letter that says to fill them in within 1-2 hours. Although the big-headed wallomat, who is giving the assignment, probably thinks that he is sitting there wondering what the people are doing. Recently, a letter came from the ministry. There is a content that says to nominate a candidate for participation in the competition of writing training manuals for technical schools. In order to participate in the competition, the applicant was asked to submit the program, topics, consistency in them, and the fully written state of the first chapter. The deadline is two days)) At this time, it is only possible to copy the previously prepared items. You never have time to write something new. Here you will learn why the textbooks in Uzbekistan are in the same situation, because the people at the top give you one week/month to write such and such a textbook/study guide. those below are similar. Yes, they make comparisons, because in order to write a real textbook or study guide, it is necessary to spend months of time, search, sort, systematize and organize information. What is even more interesting is that at the same time, schools with low performance in the regions where they are located are attached to higher educational institutions. And the task is simple - to help raise the indicators. At first glance, it seems like the right thing to do. In fact, it is not. How do higher education staff find time to deal with schools when their workloads are overwhelming? Now, if teachers of higher education are engaged in raising the indicators of schools, it is self-evident that tomorrow, because they do not do their work on time, the indicators of higher education will also start to fall. Will another organization help to raise the indicator of higher education? The next factor is the approval of fraud from the top. This is the most disgusting, most disgraceful and most terrible situation. At the same time, professors and teachers of all universities in Uzbekistan have become plagiarists in 90% of cases. There are all existing "musor" magazines, in which articles are published by Uzbeks. No head of higher education will prevent his employees from this. Because everyone needs a result, a number. Neither the ministry nor higher education institutions have anything to do with quality. If the ministry or any higher education institution objects to my statement, I can prove it. According to Google Scholar, the h-indexes of most professors and teachers in higher education institutions are higher than 20. Your mouth will drop open. But neither Scopus nor Web of Science databases recognize these "geniuses". Because most of the articles are fake, published in "magazines" that will print any rubbish material as "articles" if you pay them. I will write a separate post about article citation fraud cases. You will cry if you leaf through printed textbooks, study guides, and monographs. In short, almost no one is interested in the contents of textbooks. The important thing is to print. The whole country is chasing numbers, and this is supported by the ministry itself. The next biggest factor that bogs down higher education is the violation of the basic principle of educating students. Our credit-module system is unique to us. Neither aunt nor aunt. In short, a customized, renamed and slightly edited version of the previous system. We treat students like kindergarten children. When I was a graduate student in 2012-2014, we had a meeting of parents. Can you imagine that most of those who are studying at the master's degree are parents themselves, but they called their parents. Where is the logic? After getting a passport, shouldn't a person have his own life? Shouldn't he answer for his own actions? Why don't we let the child grow up? It is a problem to expel a student if he does not master the subject. Why? The system is like this all over the world, if a student has not mastered it, he re-reads that subject according to the credit-module system. He studies until he passes. Universities are under no obligation to grade students even if they do not know the subject. Yesterday, a student died by setting himself on fire because he failed his studies. First of all, I felt sorry for the parents of this student. Because it is not easy to raise a child stain. Following the case of that student's self-immolation, an internal order of the ministry was sent to higher education institutions throughout the republic. Why should we not leave the students behind? Yes, let's grade anyone and give a diploma. Tomorrow, who will be responsible for the fact that we graduate as experts those who call the alif kalkat? Have we been doing this for so many years? Maybe now we will teach according to the principles of real higher education? One thing should not be forgotten, higher education is not compulsory education. No one is forced to study higher education. Everyone submits documents voluntarily and starts studying. Let's read it now. It doesn't matter if he didn't study or not, let him master the subject or not. Do not take the place of another worthy person. I am absolutely against the fact that a student who has not mastered a subject because he set himself on fire, hanged himself, or threw himself out of a window is required to be given a grade in such and such a university. If a student is given a good grade even if he doesn't know how to be happy now, tomorrow the whole society will suffer from it. Why is the Ministry not taking this into account? Or it should be said frankly, our system is like that, even if they don't study, they will graduate and give a diploma. This ministry will not forget to ask why your student did not go to work tomorrow. Yes, doesn't the ministry know that it will not be easy to find a job in the labor market after the diploma is issued without enough specialists? The first factor is the answer to the allegation that the student was not well trained. So, I have a lot to say about this. I will write again as soon as I can. Because before eliminating the problem, it is necessary to identify it, talk about it in detail and discuss it. After that, a solution is sought. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/bakalavriat-va-magistratura-yonalishlari-qisqartirildi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education..
