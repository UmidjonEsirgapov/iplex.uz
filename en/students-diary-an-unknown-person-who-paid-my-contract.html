                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>This money is owed to you.</strong><br/><strong>In the middle of the conversation, I asked him if he did me a favor even though I was rude. He said. I don't have a soum to pay for the contract, I had to take an academic leave of absence from my studies. the truth! <p>In "Life Stories", get to know the story of a former student who, while studying at a university, also received the highest education of life.</p> <p>"I became a student 10 years ago. Until then, this was my biggest dream, I didn't get to study for 3 years, I prepared very hard, I didn't know what sleep is. But I learned that studying does not mean that you have achieved all your dreams and now you can live peacefully. From the bedroom, you can see the bottom of the money that goes to food and drink. I'm using it very sparingly, but it's not delivering. My father bought one of the two cows in our house and sent the money. I started looking for a job myself. I worked in the flea market, I was a guard. Getting a higher education is not only about a diploma. The lessons you learn during this period can change your life and your worldview. The doctors said that he had a problem with his liver, that it had started to turn into cirrhosis, and that he needed serious treatment. It was as if a mountain had fallen on our head. We started selling everything in the house, and my father used to beat himself up for my mother's medicine. In this situation, it was a difficult matter to pay the contract for my studies. Seeing their condition, I thought that I should earn more money.</p> <p>We admitted my mother to a hospital in the capital. We have nothing left to capture at home. My father went to work in Russia out of desperation. I brought my two sisters with me. Fortunately, I got a job in a big restaurant. Only had to work at night. But they pay well, and I eat very well. It was a good offer for someone like me who has to save money even for eating out. My sisters will receive messages from my mother, I will deliver the medicines myself. After school, I go to work and return to the rented house in the early morning. Complications of insomnia began to be felt in a month. Falling asleep, being late for studying, falling asleep in classes has become a habit. Naturally, my teachers didn't like it. I began to hear reprimands and warnings.</p> <p>Among our teachers was a very knowledgeable but demanding professor who taught us. We all respected him, were surprised, and tried not to listen to him, because he was an expert in his field. One day I was late for this teacher's class. As soon as I entered, I apologized and was greeted with words that were like a trance.</p> <p>"We know that some of you work while studying. But your parents sent you here to study and become a good specialist. Therefore, I ask you to put your studies first in any situation. Some information that you did not learn today could be a very necessary fact for you someday. "You entered the university on your own, now you don't have the right to use this knowledge." I didn't know if it was because I was tired of sleeplessness, fatigue, constant worries, I was rude to him. There was a moment of silence in the auditorium. Our teacher allowed me to sit calmly even if he got angry.</p> <p>My father, who works in Russia, started sending money every month, albeit a little. But I don't know whether it was because of the severe winter there, or because my father, who was getting old, lost his strength, he got sick with a bad cold there. My heart ached thinking about my sick father traveling with my sick mother. I did not even know that the payment of the study contract was delayed due to these worries. After repeated warnings, I don't have a single soum to pay for it, and I had to try to pay for the medicines prescribed by the doctor who was taking care of my mother. After thinking about it, I decided to take an academic leave of absence from my studies. Because now I was not worried about the life of my parents. I decided not to tell them, but to tell them later when I had recovered my studies. When I went to write an application for a leave of absence, I was surprised to find out that they took the contract for my studies and paid me one year. I checked again and again that it might have been a mistake - it's true. I was in a worse situation when I found out that the same teacher I talked to received the contract paper. If I am ashamed of something I did, I felt as if my pride had hit the ground that a woman paid for me.</p> <p>I went to my teacher in anger. That I am not forced to give him charity, that I am self-sufficient, that I do not depend on someone else's help... So I have nothing left to say.</p> <p>"I am not a person who gives so many million soums in charity to someone. I make ends meet. This money is owed to you. So that you do not fall behind in your education. You will return this money as soon as you finish your studies and start working. I will tell you who to give it to, not me. Now you have to study, because the money has been paid," said the sister with the same composure.</p> <p>I went to study with inexplicable feelings of surprise and embarrassment. On the one hand, I comforted myself by saying, "Well, it's a debt, maybe I'll pay it back with more." My father recovered and went to work. When I went to get the news, I cried when the doctor told me that we had taken good care of my mother and that she would be completely cured soon, no matter how expensive it was, and that she would get well soon. I had to master the remaining lessons and become a good specialist.</p> <p>This feeling didn't leave me until I got a job and started getting paid. I thought that I should get rid of the burden on my shoulders as soon as possible. I collected my first salary and went to my teacher with a little more than what I was paid for that contract. I was leaving with a different sense of pride, probably because I had proven myself.</p> <p>I found my teacher at the department, I told him that I came to get rid of my debt from the person who paid me. In the middle of the conversation, I asked him if he was kind to me even if I was rude.</p> <p>"I know that you entered your studies with your own strength and how you study. Lately, I noticed that you are late for studies and that your mind is not in the right place. Then, when I asked, your fellow students said that your mother is ill, your father is away, and you work at night. Sometimes you want to study, but because of your financial situation, There are acquaintances who help struggling students. I asked one of them and your contract fee was paid. That's all. I'll call you now, and I said, "I'm going to take the money to whomever you want." called that good person. As soon as I picked up the phone, I hurriedly greeted and thanked him. I told him that he did me a great favor, and now I want to repay my debt, and I will reach the place he said.</p> <p>"First of all, I congratulate you on finishing your studies and starting a job. If even one educated and knowledgeable person joins our society, the reward will reach all of us. In fact, there are many people who have this reward. If you want, you can become the recipient of the reward right now. Do you want to do this?" said the voice from the other side.</p> <p>I said that I would like to join such a job, but now I don't have such an opportunity.</p> <p>"You have a chance. The money in your hand is yours. I have given it away. But now someone may be dropping out of school because of this money or not being able to study at all. All you have to do is find such a person and help him. Whether he wants it or not. If you are a man, the number of merits may increase by one. You understand what I mean. The time will come when you will be in my place. Remember, I was once in your place. If there are more people who want to do good, our rewards will increase and it will increase.</p> <p>She was upset by the conversation and said that she could not tell who this person was without first asking, because she would be upset.</p> <p>I was very envious of that person. I wanted to be in his place someday, to continue the chain. Together with my professor and mentor, we transferred that money for the contract by investigating needy students. It seemed like half of my work was done. After some time, when he wanted to return it, I felt relieved as if I had fulfilled my duty when I replied with those words that were imprinted in my mind". — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/5-yil-stajga-ega-xotin-qizlar-uchun-tavsiyanoma-olish-muddati-31-maygacha" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p></strong>
