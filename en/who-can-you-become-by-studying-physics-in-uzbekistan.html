                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Then you can work on any problem correctly and easily!</strong><br/><strong>I am the person responsible for all issues related to the teaching of physics in "Registon", the leader of physics teachers in the "Registon" educational project.</strong><br/><strong>We have physics. whether it is online video lessons on physics, physics olympiads and competitions, tests, books and manuals... the "Registon" physics education council, which includes everything, controls quality education.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Physics is taught in different ways everywhere. This is related to the skills of teachers and pedagogical methods. But in the "Registon" educational project, physics is taught in a completely different way. Based on the demands and suggestions, today we have prepared for your attention a great interview with Marufjon Omonov, the chairman of the "Registon" Physics Education Council (leader teacher), the physics teacher of the "Registon" Mega branch, the senior teacher, the director of the "Registon" Mega branch! In my opinion, there are few people who want to study with interest. Tell me, how do you feel about studying physics just to score well in DTM exam, can that be a GOAL?</p> <p>– You are indeed right. In the conditions of Uzbekistan, many people study physics only to enter the university. There are few people who are interested in this subject, but they are not absent. Studying physics just to get into university is the worst way to go. Why am I saying this? Every person has goals and plans for living in life, and it is through them that he achieves his dreams. First of all, each of our students should set the goal correctly. No matter what subject he studies, whether it is physics, English, or mathematics, it does not matter, if I learn this subject, how much it will benefit people in the future, if I can connect my future with this subject, if I can see myself as an expert in this subject, then he should study. our students think that physics is very difficult and complicated. In fact, this is also a mistake. Physics is an interesting and vital science. Because physics has served to make our lives easier and ease our burdens from the distant past to the present day. Techniques and technologies are developed based on the laws of physics, all the devices around us, the phone, laptop, watch and other gadgets in your hand are also products of physics. I always tell my students not to study physics just to pass the exam. After all, when the light goes out in your house, isn't it a pleasure to be able to fix it yourself without calling a master?! This will be physics too, brother!</p> <p class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VJ6P2g_OsQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p></p> <p><strong>- Who will be the student who studied physics and studied in this direction? What are the possibilities for him in our society? Or is a physics teacher limited to becoming a physicist?</strong></p> <p>- No, that's not all. Students who have studied physics can study and work in many fields. For your understanding, I will mention the fields related to physics in the conditions of Uzbekistan: architecture and construction, aviation and piloting, geology and exploration systems, cadastral systems, information technology, transport, oil and gas, telecommunication systems, water management and agriculture, artificial intelligence and robotics, energy, etc. If you pay attention, the ones we listed are the "trendy" professions that people apply to both in the city and in the countryside. Can you imagine our life without them? These fields are the main factor that plays an important role in the development of not only Uzbekistan, but also every country.</p> <p>Now I would like to draw your attention to statistics: the total number of educational fields of the State Admission Commission for bachelors in 2023 is <strong>484</strong>, of which 177, i.e. 37 percent, are related to the field of physics and mathematics. This is a much higher indicator than economics (16 percent), natural sciences (14 percent), social humanitarians, and languages. It is clear that physics and mathematics have much more opportunities than other fields. Even if you pay attention to the admission quotas, physics and mathematics have more applicants than other fields. The main reason for this is that the demand for techniques and technology is increasing in today's era of globalization, so the demand for good physicists is also high all over the world! let's take a graduate applicant. In front of him is either to go to a physics tutor and study and become an expert in his field in the future, or to study programming and leave the IT field. How many reasons can you give why he chose physics instead of programming? Are there any reasons?</p> <p>- As I said above, a person should enjoy the direction he chooses, regardless of the subject or field he studies. Knowledge is "infected" in that way, you work with enthusiasm, not with frustration, you don't go to work every morning, but return to your hobby during the day. I think a student should make a decision before graduation, it's <strong>too late to decide what to choose!</strong> It's like looking for a ticket for a plane flight when your peers have already reached their destination...</p> <p>Now about your question about IT or physics. Actually, my specialty is IT, I studied artificial intelligence. In addition, I have implemented many projects and researches in this field. For example, I easily mastered the field of IT precisely because I understood physics well. I also have a background in business, management or administration. Physics is the cause of all this, I live with physics!</p> <p>Physics has broadened my imagination, developed my outlook and sharpened my mind. I believe that anyone who has studied this subject can easily solve the problems they face in any field during their life. In addition, he does not lose his temper in difficult situations. I can't say for sure whether it is possible to learn IT without understanding physics, but <strong>IT is not difficult for a person who understands physics,</strong> he learns this field very easily! If we have brothers who dream of becoming "Aytishniks", let them study physics well, they will definitely be the best in their field, they will become real experts!</p> <p><img .="" awaits="" class="size-medium wp-image-22240 aligncenter" future="" physicists?<="" src="https://rgn.uz/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4-photo_2022-11-13_21-08-41-300x200.jpg" strong="" what=""/></p> <p>- There are many people who have mastered physics perfectly and achieved great success. At the moment, I will not mention Einstein, Newton or Edison, who are familiar to everyone. Because you know about them well. I want to talk about the people around us who are our contemporaries: Today, <strong>Ilon Musk</strong> is always at the top of the list of the richest people in the world. If you know, his knowledge and inventions that surprise the whole world are built on the basis of physics. After his discoveries and researches in physics, today he is a world-renowned success leader and head of large companies.</p> <p>Let alone the world, Islam Karimov, the first president of Uzbekistan, also studied physics and graduated from the Central Asian Polytechnic University, then worked in the field of aviation. He recorded in his memories that physics came in handy both in politics and in state administration. The politician who contributed to Uzbekistan's independence and ruled the country for a quarter of a century was a physicist by profession. Today, our current president, Shavkat Miromonovich, has mastered the secrets of physics, graduated from the Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers, and worked as a mechanical engineer. In general, people who want to study physics do not have to go far. <strong>The "heroes" are walking in front of your eyes.</strong></p> <p><strong>- What is the difference between a physics problem and a mathematical problem? Which is more difficult?</strong></p> <p>- In fact, there is almost no difference between physics and mathematics. If they are two different sciences, how can it be, you might say. But it is. The language of physics is mathematics. In both cases, the final result is important. Students who are strong in mathematics will learn physics very quickly and easily. After all, the great physicist Newton was also a mathematician first. In my opinion, a person who is good at mathematics does not struggle with physics, or vice versa. The important thing is hard work, passion and frustration, then everything will be fine. Don't divide this subject as easy, this subject is difficult, just read, learn and succeed!</p> <p><strong>- What are your recommendations for solving physics problems easily and correctly?</strong></p> <p>- Never solve problems just by putting them into a ready-made formula. First of all, read the issue carefully and think in your head, analyze, understand the essence without writing in a notebook. You need to know which formula to put in and be sure you can get the right result with that formula. Imagination plays an important role in solving problems in physics correctly and accurately. How can I increase the power of imagination, you may say. For this, you need to thoroughly study theoretical rules and proof of formulas. Then you will be able to work on any problem correctly and easily!</p> <p>I have a second recommendation, the physics teachers of the "Registon" educational project reviewed the problems that many students had problems with, as well as popular problems with a high probability of failing the exam, as part of the "101 solutions to 101 problems" project. Through this, our students can get direction in working on the problem, see how and in what way the correct answer is obtained, and further develop the skill of working on the problem. <p><strong>- What is the income of a person who is a specialist in physics, who works on himself and truly masters his profession? Precisely in the conditions of Uzbekistan?</strong></p> <p>- The most frequently asked question and the answer is interesting to many! A person who has studied physics in our country has two options:</p> <ol> <li>a) to teach physics to the next generation;</li> <li>b) to work in a field related to physics.</li> </ol> <p>There is a high demand for physics specialists abroad, and accordingly, their monthly income is also very high! Leave it aside, we will analyze our real situation. True, the monthly income of school teachers teaching physics in our country is not very high. But today, teachers who can work on themselves and meet various criteria are earning up to 1000 USD. If they win various grants, they can go to a foreign country and have a rest. Whether it's physics, chemistry, whatever, it's all up to you. Be the best in your field, if necessary, be one, no matter what happens to you, if you don't "get stuck under the money", you will come to us!</p> <p><strong>- Are there enough conditions in the educational centers for teaching physics? What facilities are available in this regard at "Registon"?</strong></p> <p>- Physics is taught differently everywhere. But everyone teaches one thing, if someone takes a long and complicated path to the destination, someone chooses the closest path that will ultimately lead you to success. This is a process related to teachers' experience, pedagogical skills and methods. If you don't learn from a reliable and effective teacher, it's a waste of your valuable time! Because I worked only at the "Registon" educational center, I can give you information about the situation in "Registon", you can compare it with others and draw a conclusion. Whether we have physics online video lessons, physics olympiads and competitions, tests, books and manuals... the "Registon" physics education board oversees quality education. The goal of our council is to carry out practical work on the teaching of physics, correct and easy teaching of students in the "Registon" educational project.</p> <p><img class="size-medium wp-image-22238 aligncenter" src="https://rgn.uz/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2-photo_2023-03-20_11-23-07-300x225.jpg"/></p> <p>In addition, we regularly have a special "Registon" physics methodology educational project. This methodology includes the necessary directions for how a student can master physics perfectly from scratch during one course. During the program, lessons are organized based on our physics collections, 5 large repetition exams, open and closed weekly tests systematically held every Sunday, special tests of 5 blocks once a month. In the repeat exam of our methodology, the question-and-answer part, special methods of memorizing formulas and units, exercises on the formation of students' ability to quickly and easily solve problems. This methodology is applied in all our branches, our goal is based only and only on mega-results!</p> <p>Furthermore, distance online lessons in Physics in a quality format are hosted on the You Tube platform of the "Registon" educational project. Students who do not have the opportunity or time to study at the educational center can learn physics through video tutorials. We are always on the side of applicants, our educational center has branches in all regions of the republic, and we regularly communicate with students on social networks. Since we are "open" to applicants, we know better what they want, our ranks are wide, our path and face are always bright, our goals are common!</p> <p class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLOLz2vuEAiKKm0OaZyojPdnthlaMWh5K1"></iframe></p> <p> If you want to start, but you don't have the courage and motivation, break the wall in front of you and start studying. Because, unlike other subjects, entering the science of physics, learning it at the beginning seems a bit complicated, but after a certain time, you will become a diver in the sea of ​​physics. You dive into science, you swim among issues, and you can't get out of the "water". You will adapt to science and it will become an easy and interesting activity for you. Gradually, you will reach a level where it becomes enjoyable and enjoyable. Everything will happen with hard work and patience, it is enough if you try without melting!</p> <p>Secondly, if you have started to prepare, definitely go to the end. Never start physics only to quit halfway through. Have you entered, hold on, study this field thoroughly, if necessary, be interested in the fields related to physics, work in these directions, and regularly increase your experience. Keep studying to create something useful for all people.</p> <p>My third recommendation is to enjoy the time of studying physics or working in a specific field related to physics. If you do not enjoy the subject you are studying, if you count the hours when you go to work and wait to return home, you are not living, but only living. And when you study with such disappointment, you will not gain knowledge!</p> <p><img class="size-medium wp-image-22237 aligncenter" src="https://rgn.uz/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1-photo_2023-05-14_16-20-22-300x200.jpg"/></p> <p class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gkp3c0urmhw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p></p> <p>Still hesitating whether to study physics or not, can't find motivation? Then re-read the same interview from beginning to end, read it carefully, the hope that will radically change your whole future life can be found in this interview... — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/nega-abituriyentlar-xalqaro-nordik-universitetini-tanlamoqda-5-asosiy-sabab" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education..</p>
