                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>This year there will be an exam in 5 subjects. According to the Statement No. 13 of the State Commission for Admission to Educational Institutions of the Republic of Uzbekistan for the 2022-2023 academic year, a set of subjects will be tested in accordance with the baccalaureate educational directions of the republic's higher education institutions. the number of test tasks and evaluation criteria have been confirmed.</strong><br/><strong>30 points are given for each skill in the foreign language creative exam, a total of 120 points.</strong><br/><strong>But last year we gave five minutes, and I think it will be the same this year.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>There are only a few days left for university entrance exams. 600,000 students will graduate this year. Including those who graduated from schools in previous years, a total of <strong>1,700,000 applicants </strong>are expected to submit applications for admission to higher education institutions.</p> <p>For the third year in a row, the tests for admission to undergraduate programs of higher educational institutions will be held in <strong>stadiums and avenues</strong> due to the coronavirus.</p> <p dir="auto">It is known that this was confirmed by the State Admissions Commission statement No. done by the State Test Center.</p> <p dir="auto">This year's sample answer sheet has also been approved.</p> <div class="intext_adf" id="native_network209075870252"></div> <p dir="auto"><img alt="" src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/8/dDh1Oyh87aZfAcBg5Lofm3Uu0FnQxq1d.jpg"/></p> <div class="inpage_adf" id="inpage_VI-258336-0-898142432"></div> <div id="native_network_interscroller"></div> <p dir="auto"> approved:</p> <ul dir="ltr"> <li>a list of 82 newly opened bachelor education courses in the academic year 2022/23 and a set of subjects for which the corresponding test (professional (creative) exam) will be submitted;</li> <li>a list of bachelor education courses requiring special talent;</li> <li>professional (creative) exam in a foreign language list of educational fields.</li> </ul> <p dir="auto"><strong>In addition to professional (creative) exams, three subjects are mandatory for admission to fields requiring special talent:</strong></p> <ul dir="ltr"> <li>mother tongue (Uzbek, Russian or Karakalpak language);</li> <li>mathematics;</li> <li>DTM in the history of Uzbekistan </li> </ul> <p dir="auto"><strong>Applicants who have passed a professional (creative) exam in a foreign language will be awarded a graded (proportional) score in the entrance tests to higher education institutions as a percentage of the maximum score determined in the subject of a foreign language.</strong></p> <p dir="auto">Applicants who have chosen courses for which a professional (creative) exam will be given in a foreign language will receive only 6 higher educational institutions. </p> <p dir="auto">At the same time, applicants who take a professional (creative) exam in a foreign language will not be allowed to choose educational areas in which foreign language tests will be given. forms of education, including distance education, the admission quota has been formed</p> <p>According to the "road map" project for the implementation of the Development Strategy in 2022-2026, based on the proposals, it is planned to increase the admission parameters. delivery is planned.</p> <h4><strong>This year there will be an exam in 5 subjects</strong></h4> <p>With statement No. 13 of the State Commission for Admission to Educational Institutions of the Republic of Uzbekistan for the 2022-2023 academic year, the set of subjects for which the test will be given, the number of test tasks, and the evaluation criteria confirmed. The <strong>applicant assessment criterion has changed, which also changes the scope of 5 fields of study.</strong></p> <p>Now, like last year, applicants are not given 3.1 points for both subjects in the specialty block, but 2.1 points are given to the 2nd subject. Officials explained why such a change was introduced.</p> <p dir="auto">On April 26, a press conference was held with the participation of officials of the State Test Center and the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education on the issues of this year's admission. At the conference, it was explained that the criteria for evaluating applicants has changed this year.</p> <div class="intext_adf" id="native_network307165730069"></div> <p dir="auto">"If the same points were given to 2 subjects in the specialty block last year, this year the first subject will be given 3.1 points, and the second subject will be given 2.1 points. There is a reason for such a change. For example, mathematics. Young people with higher knowledge of physics should enter the field of mathematics. In the previous year, there were cases of the opposite: there were cases when a child who knew physics better entered mathematics.</p> <div class="inpage_adf" id="inpage_VI-258336-0-898142432"></div> <div id="native_network_interscroller"></div> <p dir="auto">In addition, giving the same points after the end of one semester leads to situations where students try to transfer their studies to the direction they know better. Therefore, the highest point in the field of study was taken as a criterion, and this does not cause inconvenience to the applicant," said Abduvali Khalikov, head of the general department of the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education. It is noted that this change in the evaluation criteria will also affect the scope of the applicants' choice of 5 areas. subject:</p> <ul> <li>Mother language (Uzbek, Russian or Karakalpak language) - 10 questions.<br/>1.1 points for each.<br/>Maximum score - 11 points.</li> <li>Mathematics - 10 questions.<br/>1.1 points for each.<br/>Maximum score - 11 points.</li> <li>History of Uzbekistan - 10 questions.<br/>1.1 points for each.<br/>Maximum score - 11 points.</li> </ul> <div class="intext_adf" id="native_network613057959029"></div> <p><strong>Total possible points - 33 points.</strong></p> <div class="inpage_adf" id="inpage_VI-258336-0-898142432"></div> <div id="native_network_interscroller"></div> <p><strong>In 2 subjects suitable for undergraduate education:</strong></p> <ul> <li>1st subject - 30 questions.<br/>3.1 points for each.<br/>Maximum score - 93 points.</li> <li>Subject 2 - 30 questions.<br/>2.1 points for each.<br/>Maximum points - 63 points.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Total possible points - 156 points.</strong></p> <h4><strong>What is the maximum points this year?</strong></h4> <p>In general, 2022-2023 during the academic year, applicants are given a total of 90 test tasks in 5 subjects. The maximum possible score is <strong>189 points</strong>.</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/2/1100__OAiI6WQQwmUyDBMfgNPGotXNsACldaf1.png"/></p> <p><strong>Where will the exams be held? What conditions will be created for entrants?</strong></p> <p>Deputy Director of the State Testing Center, Sardor Rajabov, informed that preparations for this year's tests have begun:</p> <p dir="auto">- In accordance with the decision of the State Commission, it was decided that the tests will be held in open avenues and stadiums. Their list was approved and the State Test Center notified applicants and their parents about it. As for the organization, we are organizing the tests in open stadiums and avenues, not the first year, but the third year.</p> <div class="intext_adf" id="native_network972974981793"></div> <p dir="auto">54 stadiums and avenues were selected. All conditions are created there. First of all, we plan to identify the applicants, check them in using Face-ID, and then put a camera and two supervisors in each group. In addition, test processes are broadcasted live. A pen and water are provided at every stop. If the decision of the special commission to issue medical masks is accepted, the masks will also be distributed. "Comparing to last year, we will try to make the quality of the organization even better," said Sardor Rajabov.</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>- Since it is summer, the temperature is very hot, is it not considered to distribute hats to the applicants?</strong></p> <p dir="auto">- Hats have been distributed for two years. If there is a place, a hat is also given. Even if the applicants come with their own hat, there is no restriction dir="auto"&gt;- This year, if a foreign language is included as the first language in 6 higher education institutions, and according to the president's decision, registration for the courses that will be given by July 10 is scheduled (listening, reading and speaking) exam. There is a question of how they will be organized and evaluated. The format of the tests will be B1. You can also take an online exam on our website dir="auto"&gt;A total of 120 points are awarded for each skill in a foreign language. This score is converted to 93 points. If you entered the test and showed a total of 80% of the 93 points, you will be awarded 80% of the 93 points.</p> <p> Also, the creative exams are organized in closed premises, because it is impossible to conduct the listening comprehension exam in the open air. The applicant enters the system by entering the JShIR. dir="auto"&gt;If the scores given by the first and second experts are different, the program automatically sends it to the 3rd expert. The program takes the scores of two experts close to each other We have a database of experts. DTM or someone cannot choose to send the work of such and such an applicant to such and such an expert. will it be?</p> <p dir="auto">– Exams will be organized in all regions. We conduct tests in the same way as the CEFR foreign language exams are organized.</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>- Will a late applicant lose the right to take the test?</strong></p> <p dir="auto">- The regulation approved by Government Decision 261 stipulates that a late applicant will not be admitted to the tests. First, a late applicant is a nuisance to others. Because the supervisor will explain how to fill in the answer sheet and the book of test tasks. It will not be possible to re-explain to a late applicant, as this will inconvenience others. In addition, applicants may have objections in the sense that they "came and sat after the test books were opened." In the first year, the test started at 8:00 a.m., and we didn't enter it even if it was a minute late. But last year we gave five minutes, and I think it will be the same this year. However, no one will be admitted to the test after the tests have started.</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>- Will the tests be held this year from August 1 to August 15, or will there be some changes?</strong></p> <p dir="auto">- The commission will decide when and how the exams will be held. Because it is not known how many applicants there will be, the admission is not over yet. After receiving information about all the applicants, they will be allocated according to the seats, and how many days the tests will last will be determined.</p> <p dir="auto">The avenue and stadiums are being prepared now, and the test period will be announced after all organizational work is completed. I think it will start at the beginning of August and it will be known how many days it will last depending on the number of applicants. It is not allowed to bring in a phone, a watch, or any kind of bedding. Applicants are mostly excluded for this reason. Also, if they exchange the question book or talk to each other, try to sit and take the test instead of another applicant, they will be disqualified.</p> <p dir="auto">It was observed last year that they somehow bring in the phone and take out the question book in the picture. The question book is prepared individually for each applicant. When he took out the picture, the number of the question book was visible. We can find out which exam point such a digital book has gone to. We picked up the cameras and saw that he was using the phone, and excluded the applicant.</p> <p dir="auto">After that, they closed the number of the question book and started distributing it, but since it is an individual option, we will determine to whom the options in that sequence of questions belong, and we will pick up the camera and exclude that applicant from the test.</p> <p><strong>What is targeted admission?</strong></p> <p>Targeted admission is a quota allocated due to the lack of personnel in some <em><u>territory</u></em> and <em><u>directions</u></em>.</p> <div class="intext_adf" id="native_network974518415872"></div> <p>It is up to the applicant to apply for the targeted quota or not: if he wishes, the document at the time of submission, he must specify that he wants to participate in the target admission.</p> <div class="inpage_adf" id="inpage_VI-258336-0-898142432"></div> <div id="native_network_interscroller"></div> <p>The target quota is different from the general quota, in which it is possible to study on the basis of a state grant even with a lower score. But later, the student must work in his region for a certain period of time and only after that he will receive his diploma.</p> <p>You can familiarize yourself with the admission parameters for the targeted quota here.</p> <p><strong>Can graduates of the technical school not enter the OTM?</strong></p> <p>At a meeting held by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev last month, <em><u>starting from 2023</u></em> technical schools graduates of excellent schools said that the procedure for entering universities without an exam will be canceled.</p> <p>This news is causing misunderstandings among some applicants, that is, those who graduated from technical schools will not be able to enter OTM?</p> <div class="intext_adf" id="native_network478773258123"></div> <p>According to DTM, the school, academic lyceum, All students who have graduated from vocational school, college, technical school, general secondary education or secondary specialized, vocational educational institutions can study at the higher education institution.</p> <p>So, applicants and applicants have the opportunity to participate in this year's exams without fear.</p> <p><strong>Those who graduated this year </strong><strong>in the online list</strong><strong>n in transition</strong><strong> does not enter the information of the educational institution they graduated from?</strong></p> <p>Applicants enter information about the educational institutions they graduated from the site when registering online for admission to the OTM, except for those who completed the 11th grade this year. Their information is obtained from the electronic database of the ministry, which is under the jurisdiction of the educational institution where they studied.</p> <p>However, due to the fact that the information of some educational institutions of their graduates is not completely entered into the relevant database, the relevant information does not appear when the applicants register online. asks them to apply to the educational institution they studied at (school, lyceum, vocational school).</p> <p>After the educational institution enters the relevant information into the database, the applicants can update the information of the educational institution they graduated from by clicking the "Update" or "Download" button in the "Educational institution they graduated from" section. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/davlat-oliygohiga-imtihonsiz-oqishni-kochirish-uchun-ariza-qanday-yoziladi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>You can read this news. how do you look Leave a comment..
