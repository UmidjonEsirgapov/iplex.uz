                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Below are six rules that are considered important in the way of learning: 1️⃣ Parents' prayers Parents' prayers are important for the increase and perfection of knowledge.</strong><br/><strong>3️⃣ Attitude Seriousness is good, but too much arrogance is an obstacle to learning. </strong><br/><strong>Conclusion If you follow these rules, it will be much easier for you to succeed in the path of science.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2><strong>6 important rules that lead to success in learning</strong></h2> <p>Learning is not just about reading books or attending classes. In order for it to be successful, it is necessary to follow <strong>spiritual and life rules</strong>. Below are the <strong>six rules</strong> that are considered important on the way to learning:</p> <h3><strong>1️⃣ Parental prayer</strong></h3> <p>Parental prayer is important for the increase and perfection of knowledge. If you act with their approval, success will be close to you. To be sure, <strong>open your hands in prayer</strong> in the morning.</p> <h3><strong>2️⃣ Prayer of teachers</strong></h3> <p>Knowledge is something that passes from one person to another. It can be read in books, but <strong>the experience and blessings given by the teacher are priceless</strong>. Respect your teacher and seek to learn from him.</p> <h3><strong>3️⃣ Attitude</strong></h3> <p><strong>Seriousness is good, but too much arrogance hinders learning.</strong> Use what you learn with kindness, not arrogance. Then science will take you to greater heights.</p> <h3><strong>4️⃣ Sleep</strong></h3> <p>Sleep management is important in the path of science. <strong>Too much sleep while studying is a temptation of the devil</strong>. Therefore, walking with ablution and preparing for class will make your work blessed.</p> <h3><strong>5️⃣ Not skipping classes</strong></h3> <p>Today's missed class will be twice as heavy tomorrow. <strong>A backlog of tasks leads to sluggishness</strong> and slows down the learning process. That is why it is important to prepare lessons on time every day.</p> <h3><strong>6️⃣ Time</strong></h3> <p>Time is the most precious gift in human life. <strong>He never comes back, he just leaves.</strong> Therefore, using time efficiently and not delaying it is one of the important factors in the path of science.</p> <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3> <p>If you follow these rules, it will be much easier for you to succeed in the path of science. <strong>Education is always an ongoing process, and it is important to approach it correctly!</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/maktab-oquvchilari-uchun-buyuk-britaniyada-tashkil-etiladigan-yozgi-maktabda-qatnashish-imkoniyati-beruvchi-insholar-tanlovi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
