                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Pistachios and nuts It is known that eating pistachios is very useful.</strong><br/><strong>By the way, in terms of protecting mental abilities, eating other berries, such as blackberries, also helps.</strong><br/><strong>Apples This fruit contains many useful vitamins. </strong><br/><hr/> <p>It's no secret that for the active functioning of the brain, it is necessary to breathe fresh air, exercise regularly and eat properly. Proper nutrition is closely related to the actions in the first two points. Marie Claire publication informed what products should be included in the diet to strengthen memory.</p> <h2>Pistachios and nuts</h2> <p><img class="border ls-is-cached lazyloaded" data-action="zoom" data-src="/cache/2022/08/photo_2022-08-15_08-13-16-728x546.jpg" src="https://daryo.uz/cache/2022/08/photo_2022-08-15_08-13-16-728x546.jpg"/></p> <p>It turns out that pistachios are very useful. It contains a lot of vitamin E, which protects brain cells from damage caused by free radicals. Also, pistachios slow down the aging process in the body. Pistachios contain phospholipids and sterols, substances that literally prolong life, preserve youth and significantly improve human health. By the way, walnuts have the same properties. Flaxseed is rich in alpha-linoleic acid (one of the Omega-3 fatty acids). This acid, in turn, is used to produce DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), one of the most important substances for the brain - the area of the cerebral cortex responsible for processing sensory information.</p> <h2>Cocoa</h2> <p><img class="border ls-is-cached lazyloaded" data-action="zoom" data-src="/cache/2022/08/photo_2022-08-15_08-13-25-728x546.jpg" src="https://daryo.uz/cache/2022/08/photo_2022-08-15_08-13-25-728x546.jpg"/></p> <p>Cocoa contains flavonoids - for memory and learning there are special antioxidants that have a good effect on the areas of the brain that are responsible. Cacao is also known to slow down age-related brain changes, so having a piece of chocolate with afternoon tea is just what the doctor ordered. Naturally, chocolate should contain a lot of cocoa (at least 75 percent). But it is better to drink cocoa made from natural powder rather than a sweet semi-finished product.</p> <h2>Blue tea</h2> <p>Blue tea is a unique drink that strengthens the health of both the body and the brain. Green tea contains catechins, natural antioxidants with antibacterial properties. They reflect the attacks of free radicals, that is, they slow down the aging of the body, contribute to the prevention of cancer and mental diseases. Do not forget about the caffeine contained in green tea, which activates brain activity and improves memory.</p> <h2>Spinach</h2> <p><img class="border ls-is-cached lazyloaded" data-action="zoom" data-src="/cache/2022/08/photo_2022-08-15_08-13-33-728x542.jpg" src="https://daryo.uz/cache/2022/08/photo_2022-08-15_08-13-33-728x542.jpg"/></p> <p>Spinach, like any greens, is very useful for the body, but more so for the brain. It contains lutein, beta-carotene, folic acid, and vitamins (especially vitamin K)—all things that generally help improve cognitive functions, including active work, memory, and attention. If it is difficult to eat spinach on its own, it can be eaten with other dishes, for example, in soups, omelets or salads.</p> <h2>Eggs</h2> <p>Eggs are an excellent source of choline, one of the main components of cell membranes and an important participant in its work. It is choline that is the basis for the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which allows nerve cells to send and receive nerve impulses. Adequate daily choline intake is key to good memory. B vitamins, also found in eggs, help slow down age-related changes in brain cells.</p> <h2>Coconut</h2> <p><img class="border ls-is-cached lazyloaded" data-action="zoom" data-src="/cache/2022/08/photo_2022-08-15_08-13-42-728x542.jpg" src="https://daryo.uz/cache/2022/08/photo_2022-08-15_08-13-42-728x542.jpg"/></p> <p>Coconuts found during vacations on exotic islands are not only tasty, but also useful products. Coconut milk is rich in fatty acids, caprylic and lauric, which help keep the brain active and protect brain cells from oppression. By the way, a diet based on vegetables with coconut oil helps to lose weight quickly.</p> <h2>Avocado</h2> <p>This storehouse of energy and nutrients should be in any human diet. Avocados contain vitamin E, which improves memory and reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Another pair of important components are vitamin K and phytolates, which together protect the blood vessels of the brain from blood clots and improve its cognitive functions.</p> <h2>Blackcurrants</h2> <p><img class="border ls-is-cached lazyloaded" data-action="zoom" data-src="/cache/2022/08/photo_2022-08-15_08-13-50-728x542.jpg" src="https://daryo.uz/cache/2022/08/photo_2022-08-15_08-13-50-728x542.jpg"/></p> <p>Blackcurrant is a wonderful berry. It contains manganese, which, first of all, improves vision and keeps it at the right level. But another function of blackcurrant is to stimulate the brain and improve memory. This is helped by polyphenols, vitamins C and K, and gallic acid, which protects brain cells from stress and degeneration. By the way, from the point of view of protecting mental abilities, eating other berries along with currants also helps.</p> <h2>Apple</h2> <p>This fruit contains a lot of useful vitamins. It is not for nothing that it is said that if one apple is eaten in a day, there is no need to go to the doctor. More specifically, apples contain the antioxidant flavonoid quercetin, which protects against memory loss and reduced brain function. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/italiyada-talim-universitetlarga-qanday-hujjat-topshirish-viza-olish-va-yillik-7-ming-yevro-stipendiyaga-qanday-ega-bolish-mumkin" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources..
