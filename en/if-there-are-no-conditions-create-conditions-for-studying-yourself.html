                The latest news in education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Motivated by his father, Sundar graduates from a higher education institution in India with a degree in technology and wins a scholarship from Stanford University.</strong><br/><strong>Although he won the scholarship, he did not have money for a plane ticket to come to the United States.</strong><br/><strong>Also. However, Sundar managed to fly to the USA for the first time in order to achieve his dreams and manage one of the most famous companies in the world, Google.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Yes, it is. For example, <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong>, who now runs <strong>Google</strong>, grew up in an ordinary family in India. He didn't even have a TV in his house. Sundar's childhood was spent in a small house with two rooms. He worked as an ordinary employee at the British General Electric Company in India. Due to the motivation given by his father, Sundar graduated from a higher education institution in the field of technology in India and won a scholarship from Stanford University. The plane ticket was equivalent to 1 year's salary of Sundar's father. That's when Sundar first came to the USA by plane and today he runs one of the most famous companies in the world - Google.</p> <h3>Sundar Pichai: The path from an ordinary family to the management of Google</h3> <p>The current CEO of Google <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong> was born and raised in an ordinary family in India. He didn't even have a TV in his house. Although Sundar's childhood was spent in a small 2-room house, his father managed to instill in him an interest in technology. Sundar's father worked as an ordinary employee at the British company General Electric and told his son a lot about technology. For this reason, Sundar successfully graduated from a higher education institution in the field of technology in India and won a scholarship from Stanford University. The plane ticket was equivalent to a year's salary of Sundar's father. Nevertheless, in order to achieve his dreams, Sundar first came to the United States by plane and managed to manage one of the most famous companies in the world, Google.
