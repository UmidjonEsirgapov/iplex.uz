                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Dior Kholmatov (Attack midfielder, "Pakhtakor"): A creative midfielder who is responsible for creating opportunities for his partners, who can see the field perfectly.</strong><br/><strong>The team has a clear structure: it consists of two world-class leaders who set a high level and a strong domestic championship. a powerful support group.</strong><br/><strong>2025 is not the finish line, but the beginning of a long road for the renewed "White Wolves". The time when the result depended only on experienced veterans, as evidenced by the latest Tribuna.uz news, has gradually come to an end. The team with new blood is showing not only its character, but also tactical flexibility, underpinned by talent whose price in the transfer market speaks for itself. This is no longer just a mysterious team, but a real force to be reckoned with. <h3>European Vanguard: Khusanov and Faizullayev</h3> <p>Without exaggeration, the driving force of the current national team is its landing in Europe. Two names that represent the success of Uzbek football on the world stage stand out. The first is Abdugadir Khusanov. At the age of 21, the central defender, playing for one of the top clubs in Europe (according to the screenshot, it is the logo of "Manchester City"), reached an amazing market value of 35 million euros. This is not just a number, it is recognition of his talent at the highest level.</p> <p>The second is the creative engine of the team, Abbasbek Faizullayev. At the age of 21, he is already a key player of the Moscow club CSKA and is valued at a hefty 8 million euros. Faizullayev is a pure football intellect. His ability to find gaps between the lines, passes that intensify attacks and unusual decisions make the game of "White Wolves" unpredictable and bright.</p> <h3>Talented players of the local league team</h3> <p>In particular, a group of talents from the country's leading clubs such as "Pakhtakor" and "Nasaf" attract attention. A few key figures forming the team's closest reserve and foundation:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Abduvahid Ne'matov (Goalkeeper, "Nasaf"): at the age of 24, one of the most expensive players in his position in the league (€1.5 million) and the number one player in the national team who gives confidence to defenders.</li> <li aria-level="1">Zafarmurod Abdirahmatov (Right wing) defender, "Nasaf"): Stubborn and fast winger who can cover the entire wing.</li> <li aria-level="1">Dior Kholmatov (Attack midfielder, "Pakhtakor"): Creative midfielder who is responsible for creating situations for his partners, who can see the field perfectly.</li> <li aria-level="1">Abdurauf Boriyev (Base midfielder, "Pakhtakor"): Attacks the opponents. a worker in the center of the field, responsible for breaking down and launching their own attacks.</li> </ul> <h3>Vector of Development and Ambitions for 2025</h3> <p>The current composition of the Uzbekistan national team is a harmonious alloy of European polish and national identity. The team has a clear structure: a powerful support group consisting of two world-class leaders who set a high standard and a strong domestic championship. Judging by the potential and age of these players, it is safe to say that this "golden generation" is capable of turning the dream into reality. 2025 is not the finish line, but the beginning of a long road for the renewed "White Wolves". Stars playing in Europe, a strong domestic league and a clear strategy serve to make the team's future bright. This is a new page of "White Wolves", a strong and promising generation is coming to the scene. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/toshkentda-markaziy-osiyo-universitetlari-forumi-bolib-otdi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
