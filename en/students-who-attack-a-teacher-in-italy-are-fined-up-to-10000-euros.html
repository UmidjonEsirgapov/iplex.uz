Several new measures will be reintroduced under this law, including <strong>behavior assessments</strong>. This rating system was first introduced in 1924 by the <strong>Mussolini government</strong> and was abolished in the 2000s.</p> <p>Behavior is now rated on a <strong>10-point system</strong>. Students who score <strong>5 or less</strong> will have to retake the course. The grade of behavior also affects the results of graduation exams.</p> <p>In addition, a fine of <strong>from 500 to 10,000 euros</strong> was introduced against school employees for violence. According to <strong>The Guardian</strong>, this measure was introduced due to the increase in cases of attacks on school staff by students and their parents. In 2024, it was determined that the number of such incidents has doubled compared to 2023.</p> <p>Students have come into conflict with teachers mainly because of <strong>using mobile phones</strong> in the classroom. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/2024-2025-oquv-yili-uchun-magistratura-qabul-natijalari-elon-qilindi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
