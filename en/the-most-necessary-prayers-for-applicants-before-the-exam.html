                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Preparation for entrance exams to higher education institutions After the counting days, entrance exams to higher education institutions will be held.</strong><br/><strong>Most applicants are hard at work for this exam and try to become students day and night.</strong><br/><strong>Science We ask the Creator that all applicants who intend to take the exam will successfully pass the exams. Most of the applicants try hard for this exam and try to be a student day and night. In fact, being a student requires hard work. In this, the competition is strong, and the number of those who aim to become a student is increasing every year. <h3>The importance of trust and dua</h3> <p>At the same time, the applicant should trust God and receive the dua of parents, teachers and relatives. It is important to have the intention to acquire knowledge and to serve the Motherland, people, and family with this knowledge. We pray to the Creator that all applicants who intend to study will pass the exams successfully. Lord, God bless you"</p></strong> <p>My Lord! Make it easy, don't make it difficult. My Lord, finish my work with goodness. Make my heart wide (for this difficult task) and make it easy for me and remove the knot (stuttering) from my tongue, (<em>so</em>) that (<em>my people</em>) understand my speech (<em>good</em>).</p> <p><strong>"Rabbi zidni 'ilman wa fahman"</strong></p> <p>My Lord! Increase my knowledge and intelligence.</p> <p><strong>Source:</strong> Muslim.uz — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kollej-va-texnikumlarning-fanlar-majmuasi-va-baholash-mezonlari" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How do you look at this news?
