In particular, according to his words, girls from the regions used to walk in university dormitories and on their way to and from school without the accompaniment of men. Also, joint education of men and women continued in higher education institutions, and some girls studied in faculties "contrary to Islamic Sharia". On December 20, the Taliban banned girls from studying at universities. It is not known how long this will last. The United States and Qatar demanded a review of this decision. The UN believes that the exclusion of women from higher educational institutions is a violation of international law. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/navrozda-talabalar-4-kun-dam-oladi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p></strong>
