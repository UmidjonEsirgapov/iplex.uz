                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>International ranking: THE - 351 QS - 363 Tuition fees: Is higher education in Norway really free as it is rumored to be? to study, the student must make a deposit of NOK 123,519 (approx. 12,000 euros) in one of the Norwegian banks for the first year's expenses.</strong><br/><strong>Grants: The Norwegian government and universities offer the following grants that fully and partially cover tuition and living expenses for international students: Norwegian Government Scholarship University of Stavenger Scholarships Norwegian Science and Technology University Scholarships Application process for study: There is only one admission period for most of the educational programs in the country of Norway, and this is for studies that begin in the fall semester (September).</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Norway</strong>'s prosperous economy, the highest standard of living, and the high quality of education attract students from all over the world. Do you want to study in Norway as an international student?</p> <p>The country receives about <strong>14,000</strong> foreign students every year, adding to its national population of only 5.2 million.</p> <p><strong>The advantages of studying in Norway:</strong></p> <p><strong>Norwegian nature:</strong> Norway is one of the most attractive countries in the world. This country is the northernmost country in Europe and has a very beautiful nature. From the lowlands in the southeast, the western and northern highlands attract millions of tourists to the country every year. If you like nature travel during your vacation, then <strong>Norway</strong> is the ideal choice for you.</p> <p><img alt="See the source image" src="https://www.fjordnorway.com/imageresizer/?image=%2Fdmsimgs%2F263651395456289E9ECA5D7B918726FE98E4CE27.jpg&amp;action=ProductDetailFullWidth"/></p> <p><strong>Norwegian universities:</strong> If you are an international student, you are naturally always in tune with social, technological and political news. want to be a part of the community. And being a part of such a society opens the way to a more pragmatic education and the ability to express yourself freely without any social barriers. Norwegian universities allow you to become a part of this society. Norway has a small population and a lot of land. The population of <strong>Oslo</strong>, the largest city in Norway, is 634,000, and 28,000 of them are students studying in higher education institutions. This means that the number of students is 4% of the population. This figure compares well with the student figure in Melbourne, one of the world's most populous cities (7%).</p> <p>Norway is home to over 70 universities that offer a wide range of study programs for international students. Below are three of the world's most recognized ones:</p> <p><strong>1. University of Oslo </strong></p> <ul> <li>The largest university in the country is located in Oslo, the capital of Norway</li> </ul> <p><img alt="See the source image" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6109/6318515834_4be322300f_b.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>International ranking:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Times Higher Education (THE) - 121</li> <li>Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) - 135</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. University of Bergen</strong></p> <ul> <li>A public research university with academic diversity and high-quality teaching, considered a "core" part of the Norwegian state curriculum.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/2/1100__vUKBOqzb4Xn_gDZtulD7Eezh1O4tr0h5.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>International rating:</strong></p> <ul> <li>THE - 197</li> <li>QS - 171</li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Norwegian University of Science and Technology</strong></p> <ul> <li>Public research university with campuses in Trondheim, Gjovik and Ålesund.</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/2/1100__e2QImXxI9LT9VFsB-wIxxwUANtOtW2o2.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>International ranking:</strong></p> <ul> <li>THE - 351</li> <li>QS - 363</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Tuition fees: </strong></p> <p>Is higher education in Norway really <strong><u>free as rumored?</u> Rumors are really true ... </strong>In Norway the tuition fee, or ``contract'' price in the vernacular, is <strong>zero</strong>. However, students must be able to cover the <strong>other</strong> expenses for studying and living in higher education institutions. Most universities charge an annual administration fee of around €80-100. In addition, the student pays an average of 500 euros per semester to be able to freely use the university's <em>library, laboratory, educational materials</em> and <em>local transportation.</em></p> <p><strong>Living expenses:</strong></p> <p>In a developed country like Norway, it is natural that living expenses are high. Students spend an average of 800-1000 euros on monthly rent and living expenses. This amount is higher than in other European Union countries. Universities also provide cheaper accommodation for students, but it is usually very limited.</p> <p><strong>"Pain point":</strong></p> <p>In order to study in Norway, like in a number of other developed European countries, a student has to deposit <strong>NOK 123,519 (about €12,000)</strong> in a Norwegian bank for the first year's expenses. need This amount is <strong>full student</strong> and can be withdrawn for monthly living expenses during their studies in Norway. Through this, the government aims to ensure that the student gets education without distraction. But this aspect is a pain point for many students, as we said above. There is definitely a solution for this problem, and it is definitely provided by the country - <strong>grants</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Grants:</strong></p> <p>Norwegian state and universities offer the following grants that fully and partially cover tuition and living expenses for international students:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Norwegian Government Scholarship</strong></li> <li><strong>University of Stavenger Scholarships</strong></li> <li><strong>Norwegian Science and Technology University Scholarships</strong> Admission for this semester opens at most universities in <strong>December</strong> and closes by <strong>March</strong>. You can get the exact admission dates and the list of other necessary documents from the official website of your chosen university. <p><strong>Language requirements:</strong></p> <p>Most of these state universities have at least:</p> <ul> <li><strong>IELTS - 6.5/7.0</strong></li> <li><strong>TOEFL - 90 IBT/600 PBT</strong></li> <li><strong>CEFR - B2/C1</strong></li> </ul> <p>requires one of the international certificates indicating language level. <strong>However, these requirements may vary depending on your chosen field and university.</strong> In this matter, it is better to get information from the official website of your chosen university.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p> <p>In short, Norway, the center of culture and science of Europe, is the most ideal choice for both education and travel.
