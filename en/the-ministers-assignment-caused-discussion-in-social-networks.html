                Today's most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>This meeting was dedicated to the transfer of buildings of higher and professional educational institutions to alternative energy, increasing the quality of education, as well as raising the position of rectors, and also discussed the issue of measuring the potential of higher educational institutions by the level of employment of graduates. </strong><br/><strong>Each university in its turn fights for a job.</strong><br/><strong>The Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation has the authority to give instructions to the heads of HEIs under its jurisdiction to improve the quality of education and to warn HEIs with low quality of education.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>The Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation on social networks on February 11 In an extended meeting with the rectors and vice-rectors of higher education institutions, <strong>some points expressed by the minister Ibrahim Abdurahmanov are being interpreted differently</strong>, the information service of the ministry writes. was dedicated to raising the quality of education, as well as raising the position of rectors, and the issue of measuring the potential of higher education institutions with the level of employment of graduates was also discussed. The minister expressed his views on improving the quality of education, providing employment to graduates, creating the necessary conditions for students to become mature specialists, and helping them find work.</p> <p>When the minister gave a warning to the rectors on improving the quality of education, one goal was set - to improve the quality of education. That is, formation of graduates as personnel with potential suitable for available jobs in the labor market should be the main task of HEIs. Through social networks, "Are the same requirements imposed on prestigious higher education institutions abroad, for example, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge?" They achieved such results based on the demands of what ministers?" As for questions like - Yes, these universities are the most advanced in terms of providing employment to their graduates, and that's why their reputation is high.</p> <p><strong>As an example</strong>, one of the countries that pay special attention to the education system and achieve high results is <strong>Singapore</strong>. It is noteworthy that higher education in Singapore is given attention at the level of the defense system, that is, strict discipline and control have been established. Singapore adheres to the principle that education policy should keep pace with the country's economic and social development. That is, every graduate of OTM must have a job. The leaders of the National University of Singapore, which is ranked 11th in the world and 1st in Asia according to the QS rating, said that not one of their graduates is unemployed. It is considered that the inability of university graduates to get a job harms the prestige, honor and values ​​of this higher educational institution. Higher education institutions do not organize studies in fields where there are no jobs. Educational programs are developed taking into account the available vacancies. Each university in turn fights for a job. This creates a competitive environment in education.</p> <p>Similarly, if we look at the experience of other prestigious universities in the world (including Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge), students receive a number of offers from employers during their student years. After all, the quality of education in these universities fully meets the requirements of the labor market. All the prestigious higher education institutions in the world help their graduates to find suitable jobs. Career centers operate on the territory of each higher education institution, where various activities are organized for students and information about available jobs is provided on their sites. University employees help students with internship selections, offer the best vacancies, and conduct additional courses and training aimed at finding a job. Events are organized to give students the opportunity to meet their potential employers right from the first year. In the world's experience, 60 percent of students can find jobs in the places where they have done their internships. This implies that the heads of higher education institutions should take a more responsible approach to the employment of graduates of higher educational institutions in the changing labor market.</p> <p>The Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation has the authority to issue instructions to the heads of higher education institutions under its jurisdiction to improve the quality of education and to warn higher educational institutions with low quality of education.</p> <p>In the field of higher education in our republic, until now changes have taken place, the scope of higher education has expanded, private HEIs have been opened, and the credit-module system has been introduced. All this is the result of the reforms implemented in our country. Our task now is to improve the quality of higher education and train high-quality personnel. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kirish-imtihonlari-uchun-fanlar-majmuasi-nega-oquv-yili-boshida-chiqarilmaydi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p>
