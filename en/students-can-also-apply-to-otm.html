                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Is it possible to study at two higher education institutions at the same time?</strong><br/><strong>According to the current procedures, it is not possible to study at two higher education institutions at the same time, even if you have applied as an applicant and successfully passed the exams.</strong><br/><strong>Original document since it is unique in a copy, it can be submitted to only one HEI.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Can students also apply to HEI?</h2> <p>Any citizen who wants to study at a higher education institution (HEI), even if he is currently a student at another HEI, has the right to apply. This is a procedure introduced to ensure the openness of educational opportunities and a competitive environment.</p> <h3>Is it possible to study at two HEIs at the same time?</h3> <p>No. According to the current procedures, even if an applicant has submitted a document and successfully passed the exams, it is not possible to study at two higher educational institutions at the same time. Since the original document is unique, it can be submitted to only one OTM. And this will automatically limit the study in another HEI.</p> <h3>Is it possible to try your luck?</h3> <p>Of course, students can apply to any HEI. There is no ban on this. The main thing is to successfully pass the exams and in case of admission to the selected OTM, it will be necessary to resolve the issues of abandoning the existing study or transferring the study in an official manner. However, after acceptance, it is possible to study only <strong>in one HEI</strong>. This is for legal and technical reasons. And trying your luck is never forbidden! — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/b2-va-undan-yuqori-xorijiy-til-bilish-darajasiga-ega-fuqarolarga-xalqaro-it-sertifikatlarni-olish-xarajatlari-toliq-qoplab-beriladi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
