                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Please explain this to me in a reasonable way. ANSWER OF THE LAWYER: ❗️If there are no specific qualification requirements for the position you want to work for, you can work.</strong><br/><strong>If there is no such provision in the job description and your study time does not allow 1 rate you can work.</strong><br/><strong>According to Article 115 of the Labor Code, the normal working time for an employee cannot exceed forty hours a week.</strong><br/><hr/> <blockquote> <p>Hello. I am currently a third-year bachelor's student. Can I work in higher education institutions according to the state? (including for private ones)<br/>In what fields can I work? Please explain this to me reasonably. Each enterprise has its own internal local documents, such as internal labor rules, collective agreement, job instructions. </p> <p>Look! Article 1 of the Labor Code stipulates that labor relations are regulated by labor legislation, collective agreements, as well as collective agreements and other local regulatory documents. </p> <p>The documents mentioned above are considered local normative documents, and each enterprise can set the rules for itself in such local documents.<br/> <br/><strong>Pay attention! </strong>Article 80 of the Labor Code stipulates that the employer has the right to demand from the employee a diploma of graduation from a higher or secondary specialized vocational school, or a certificate giving the right to perform this work, or another relevant document, when entering work that can only be performed by persons with special education or special training in accordance with the law.  </p> <p><strong>If there is no such rule in the job description and your study time does not allow you to work at 1 rate.</strong><br/> <br/>Order No. 9 of the Minister of Higher and Secondary Special Education of the Republic of Uzbekistan on approval of the Regulation "On Higher Education" (list number #1222, 22.02.2003) in accordance with paragraph 50, it is established that students studying in the form of full-time education can work in higher education institutions and other organizations with an employment contract in their spare time.</p> <p><strong>It follows that students can work freely. But according to the labor legislation, a student has the right to work only during his free time from education. That is, education should be a priority.</strong></p> <p><strong>Look now! </strong>According to Article 115 of the Labor Code, the normal working time for an employee cannot exceed forty hours a week. In this case, the duration of daily work should not exceed seven hours in a six-day work week, and eight hours in a five-day work week. Also, the daily rest period between the end of work and the start of work on the next day (shift) cannot be less than twelve hours (Article 123 of the Criminal Code). </p> <p>If a student has enough free time, there is nothing to prevent him from working full-time.</p> <p> ✅ <strong>In conclusion, you can work full-time if your studies do not allow you to work. If your study time coincides with your working time, then you will have to work at the rate of 0.5 or 0.75.</strong></p> <p>Source: Legal Service — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/14-foizlik-talim-kreditidan-ham-12-fozini-qaytarib-olsa-boladi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources.</blockquote>
