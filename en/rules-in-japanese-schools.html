                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Strict but effective rules in Japanese schools The education system in Japan is characterized by its own rules that emphasize discipline, etiquette and social responsibility.</strong><br/><strong>No buffet, food is brought to the classroom Japanese schools have a separate cafeteria not.</strong><br/><strong>Each student is considered special, unique.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Strict but effective rules in Japanese schools</h2> <p>In Japan, the education system is characterized by its own rules that emphasize discipline, etiquette and social responsibility. Below are the basic rules that apply in Japanese schools.</p> <h3>Romantic relationships are strictly prohibited</h3> <p>Romantic or romantic relationships between students are not allowed in Japanese schools. The purpose of this rule is to direct the attention of young people to full study and development.</p> <h3>No cafeteria, food is brought to the classroom</h3> <p>There is no separate cafeteria in Japanese schools. State-mandated healthy meals are brought to classrooms and students are required to eat the full meals. In this way wastefulness and picky eating habits are combated.</p> <h3>There is no tradition of summer vacation</h3> <p>In Japan, instead of the usual three-month summer vacation, there are short vacations of five weeks throughout the year. During this period, teachers continue to work with students.</p> <h3>Students clean the school themselves</h3> <p>There are no janitors in Japanese schools. Each student is responsible for cleaning their classroom and surroundings. This creates a sense of order, cleanliness and community in them.</p> <h3>Simplicity in appearance - hair and cosmetics rules</h3> <p>Students are prohibited from wearing varnish, paint, and various hairstyles. The emphasis is on looking modest and simple like an elder.</p> <h3>Uniform is a symbol of equality</h3> <p>After primary school, all students wear uniforms. This serves to ensure the equality of each student.</p> <h3>Swimming is a compulsory skill</h3> <p>Every student must learn to swim in the school pool. It's not just a sport, but a life skill. Additional lessons are organized for those who fail the test.</p> <h3>Talent is in teamwork</h3> <p>There is no concept that "only the best stand out" in Japanese schools. Each student is considered unique. The goal is to equalize students, mutual support, and achieve collective success.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The Japanese education system prioritizes discipline, responsibility, and hard work. These rules serve not only good teaching, but also good education. Each student is directed to be useful to his community, school and society. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ozbekistonda-ikki-oliygohda-bir-vaqtda-oqish-imkoniyati-taklif-qilindi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit oliygoh.uz.
