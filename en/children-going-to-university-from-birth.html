                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Muhammadyusuf from Namangan was born 8 months ago.</strong><br/><strong>He first came to the building of Higher Education Institution 3 months after his birth, because his mother is a part-time student of Namangan State University.</strong><br/><strong>Kun.uz in a short video. tells about the students and parents who are studying.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>It has been 8 months since Muhammadyusuf from Namangan was born. He first came to the building of Higher Education Institution 3 months after his birth, because his mother is a part-time student of Namangan State University. In a short video, Kun.uz tells the story of students and parents studying at the university.</h4> <p class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6kaSyYWm75k"></iframe></p> <p>Gulmira Ahmedova, who promised her parents that she would educate her daughter while getting married, today she is babysitting her grandson until she leaves school. She said that since she, her husband, and her son are educated, she is trying to get her daughter-in-law a higher education as well. 15 percent of them have children under the age of 3.</p> <p>Our hero Muhammadyusuf is one of the many children who came to study with his mother and grandmother at the beginning of his studies. His mother, Gulkhumor Obidova, will finish the 4th year this year. He said that university students come to study with their children from 3 months to 2-3 years old. Muhammadyusuf also came for the first time during the autumn study period, when he was a three-month-old baby.</p> <p>Due to the large number of students who come with their babies, a room for mothers and children was also organized in the part-time study building. You can also meet grandmothers rocking cradles in that room. And some children are looked after by their aunts, uncles or sisters.</p> <p>Gulhumor Obidova says that when she comes to school, her child runs away as if he was going for a walk. It is not surprising that many women, even with families and young children, are trying to get a higher education, which is a sign that the attitude towards science is changing for the better. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/2/2-sinf-tarbiya" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p>
