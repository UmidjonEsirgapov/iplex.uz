                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>What should be done to speak a foreign language fluently?</strong><br/><strong>To master the language well, you need to know at least 1200 words.</strong><br/><strong>If your English teacher also knows Uzbek, your learning will be more effective. does.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>It is important to properly prepare</strong> to get a high IELTS score. It requires not only learning the methods of solving the test, but also a deep knowledge of the English language. Preparing for the test without a good command of the language may not give you the desired results.</p> <p>Like driving a car, when you study for your driver's license, if you lack practice, you will feel excited and challenged when you get behind the wheel. The same is true for IELTS: even if you know the test methods, it will be difficult to achieve a high score if you are <strong>not fluent in English</strong>. You can prepare for the test in 40 days after you have mastered the language.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: To get a good result in IELTS, studying the language in depth is the first and most important step. Learning how to solve a test without knowing the language is ineffective.</p> <h3>What should be done to speak a foreign language fluently?</h3> <p>One of the main issues for those who start learning a foreign language is to speak the language fluently. To master the language well, you need to know at least 1200 words. If you plan to read academic articles or do research, you will need to know at least <strong>5000 words</strong>. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to study <strong>grammar</strong> carefully.</p> <p>Although it seems difficult to master grammar, if you work diligently based on the rules of the language, your ability to know the language will develop much easier. Learning grammar by comparing it with Uzbek language rules makes the process much easier to understand. <strong>If your English teacher also knows Uzbek well</strong>, it will make your language learning more effective.</p> <p><strong>Important recommendations for language learning</strong>: — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/temurbeklar-maktabi-bitiruvchilariga-ham-4-yillik-grant-ajratiladi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <ol> <li><strong>Memorize 10 new words</strong> a day.</li> <li><strong>Learn grammar carefully</strong> and compare it with Uzbek language.</li> <li><strong>Regular and stable teaching</strong>, not to miss classes so that the load does not fall.</li> </ol> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
