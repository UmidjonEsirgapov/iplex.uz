                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>At this time, many universities have completed this process, but there are also those that have not yet entered.</strong><br/><strong>Conclusion: If you are applying for a super contract and receive a message that the contract amounts have not been entered, it may be due to the following reasons: Financial to the University independence and they set the contract higher than the basic amount.</strong><br/><strong>The price of the super-contract is calculated from the more expensive contract amount set by the university.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Recently, some applicants are having problems applying for the super-contract. They are getting <strong>"contract amounts not entered</strong>" and therefore they are not getting the contract. This situation raises many questions. Lawyer <strong>Kushnudbek Khudoyberdiyev</strong> commented on this issue.</p> <p>The lawyer said that the reason for the problem is that universities granted financial independence calculate the price of the super-contract for applicants who do not reach 4 points, not from the amount of the base contract, but from the more expensive contract price they set.</p> <blockquote> <p>In order to implement this process universities must enter their contract prices into the ministry's database. At the same time, many universities have completed this process, but there are some that have not yet introduced it. Those are the universities where the error occurs.</p> <h3>Summary:</h3> <p>If you are applying for a super-contract and receive a message that the contract amounts are not included, it may be due to the following reasons:</p> <ol> <li>The university has been given financial independence and they set the contract above the base amount.</li> <li>Super-contract price if it is calculated from the amount of the more expensive contract set by the university.</li> </ol> <p>The problem is solved when the universities enter the contract prices into the database. In this case, there is no problem in getting a contract for a super-contract, which is calculated at the price of the base contract. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/bilim-va-malakalarni-baholash-agentligi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> </blockquote> <br/><br/>What do you think about this news?
