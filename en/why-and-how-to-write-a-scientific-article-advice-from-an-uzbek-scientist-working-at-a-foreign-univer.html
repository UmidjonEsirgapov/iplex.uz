                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>It will, of course.</strong><br/><strong>It is natural that there are such journals if there is science for the sake of it or for another purpose.</strong><br/><strong>Writing an article will not be easy, publishing it will be even more difficult.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>Foreign What is the benefit of publishing articles in prestigious scientific journals to the author, the university where he works, and humanity in general? More importantly, how to write an article in English? How does the publishing process go?</h4> <div class="main-img"><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/9/CKaFdM5D1kQ0F-7-AfM9K0G8st8sAlrO.jpg"/> <div class="main-img__caption">Photo: Sherzod Mominov / Kun.uz</div> </div> <p dir="auto"> Over the past year, Sherzod Mominov, who has been a member of the editorial board of one of the leading scientific journals in his field, shared his recommendations on Twitter.</p> <p dir="auto">Although there are differences between fields, he gave his recommendations on how to write and publish a scientific article in the humanities, in particular, new history/oriental studies. It will be interesting for our readers who are engaged in scientific work or who intend to engage in it in the future. Then, what I write will not be equally relevant or interesting to everyone. At the end of my thread, I will provide a link to my published articles, you will have the opportunity to read them," says Sh. Mominov.</p>  <p dir="auto">Simply put, an article is the best way to be the first to share the innovation you are creating in your field with your colleagues, experts in a certain field.</p> <p dir="auto">There are other ways to do this, for example, giving a lecture at a conference. That is, an article is a means of formally sharing research results. That's the real essence. As the field of science is based on results, published works are considered "product" and plans are defined, articles define the reputation or position of the researcher.</p> <p dir="auto">Unlike the conference report, which is often in draft form, the article is more or less finished and polished. For this, he has to go through several "calls". The most important of these stages is "peer review", which can be translated into Uzbek as "expert evaluation".</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>Where does it start?</strong></p> <p dir="auto">The road to expert evaluation is long, so let's start from the beginning. Let's say you're a historian and you've found some new documents in the archives. You realized that you can come up with a new word based on your previous research, articles and books written by others, or comparing them.</p> <p dir="auto">This new word, for example, may shed light on incompletely understood or (in your opinion) misinterpreted pages of history, or with the help of new findings, it may be able to prove that what was previously thought to be "A" is actually "B". So how do you communicate this to others?</p> <p dir="auto">Of course, the fastest way to do this is to give a presentation at a conference. But what if your lecture goes into that ear and out of it? If it doesn't appear in print, under your name, will it be taken seriously? Moreover, what if someone gets inspired by your lecture and publishes on this topic before you?</p> <p dir="auto">No matter how hard your opponent tries, you will be the first to see the documents and analyze them in detail. Therefore, why not publish the analysis in the form of a book? It will, of course. But there's one problem: it takes years to publish a book. And the intermediate result should be announced quickly.</p> <p dir="auto">Therefore, the article is the best tool for you. Usually, the length of a scientific article is measured in words and is around 8,000-15,000 words in English. That is, the volume will not be so large. You will need to describe your news within this volume. Then, it's not enough to just write about your innovation.</p> <p dir="auto">You'll need to briefly recall the old theory or idea and explain how your new interpretation is different, or superior/new/important. To do this, you start the sentence with the problem and briefly interpret the "literature" written before you on the topic.</p> <p dir="auto">After that, you create such a "corner" for yourself with a sentence like "there are good works in the literature, but the light they shed could not illuminate all the corners of the subject." This corner is your place in your field. In it, you will explain in detail the novelty, importance, essence of your work.</p> <p dir="auto">This part is the main section of the article, and the solution to the "problem" in the introduction will also be explained in this section. In many fields, the problem is followed by theory or method sections (not necessarily in history), and the main body is followed by an example or proof section. You connect the sections logically.</p> <p dir="auto">The article ends with the final section (Conclusion). Conclusion repeats what was mentioned in the article and briefly summarizes the main findings or solutions of the author. After the end, a list of used works (Bibliography) and references (directions to other works) are given.</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>Second stage</strong></p> <p dir="auto">Well, you have criticized the article, got the opinion of close colleagues or your supervisor, made changes. You have finished writing your manuscript. But this is only the first step. Second: you identify a few journals that are closest to your field or article topic. You make a short list.</p> <p dir="auto">Nowadays, all these magazines have a website. From there you will get acquainted with the procedure and conditions for submitting a manuscript. Previously, we used to send the Word file to the editor via e-mail. Currently, most journals ask you to put the manuscript in the required form and format and upload it to the website. After reading the article, he evaluates whether it is ready to "review" or not. If it is ready, it recommends at least two "reviewers" - reviewers.</p> <p dir="auto">The managing editor sends the manuscript to the experts in a form with the identity of the author completely removed (who wrote it at all). If both agree, the "review" begins. If one of them refuses (for example, because he is busy), another reviewer will be found instead.</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>What does the reviewer do?</strong></p> <p dir="auto">In short, the reviewer answers questions such as whether the manuscript should be published, what are its shortcomings, what needs to be changed, etc. In addition to these general conclusions, some (honest) reviewers even point out spelling mistakes and give good advice.</p> <p dir="auto">Most importantly, the reviewer is not paid for this work. We just devote our time and energy to knowledge, science and education. The author also does not charge for the manuscript. But publishers sell subscriptions to the magazine for thousands of dollars to libraries and universities.</p> <p dir="auto">Those who are not members of the university or library cannot even copy these articles. In short, big publishers have turned the work of scientists into a good business, a source of free income. Thinking about his career and future, a scientist writes an article, and the publisher sees its taste. Publishing an article in a good journal is proof that a scientist earns his living. These are very important when climbing the career ladder.</p> <p dir="auto">Of course, not everything is done for career or reputation. Most scientists I know truly believe that their work will benefit society. Let us historians remain silent, but, for example, research in the field of chemistry or medicine makes people's lives easier, helps to overcome pain and suffering.</p> <p dir="auto">For example, scientists in European and British universities receive salaries at the expense of the taxpayer. For this reason, scientists consider it their duty to contribute to the development of society and humanity in general, to raise the level of knowledge of society, in addition to educating the taxpayer's children. Usually these are addressed to the author, but the managing editor will combine both reviewers' summaries and send them to the author. Let it be rejected;</p> <p dir="auto">2). Accept without changes;</p> <p dir="auto">3). Accept after certain changes have been made.</p> <p dir="auto">According to experience, it can be said that 80-90 percent of manuscripts get the third review, but there are also many rejected ones. Option 2 is very rare.</p> <p dir="auto">"The article was rejected" does not mean that so much work was wasted, of course. If it is rejected by a very famous journal, the article should be submitted to a slightly less prestigious one. A rebuttal from a reputable journal is also often very helpful, as reviewers usually provide valuable advice.</p> <p dir="auto">A reputable journal does not mean a journal published by a major university or publisher, but a journal that publishes the best research in a particular field. What determines the quality of an article? With the number of references to it from other articles/books.</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>How to identify the best article while it is still in manuscript?</strong></p> <p dir="auto">Only and only through an anonymous and extremely strict "review process", i.e. peer review. Well, why don't you say, "Brother, I need to publish an article, please help me"? Just like that! In real science, familiarity does not go away.</p> <p dir="auto">Today's leading journals have earned their status and reputation through years and decades of unbiased process and strict demand. Anonymous review ensures that the "rice" is quickly separated from the "turmeric". "Kurmak" does not even reach the process of reviewing manuscripts.</p> <p dir="auto">Of course, not all journals are good, and their selection is not impartial. There are also journals that accept articles written entirely by artificial intelligence. There are even more people who click on anything they come across to make money by buying a magazine. But who reads such magazines?</p> <p dir="auto">It is impossible to publish articles written to Khojakorsin, copied from other people's work, in other places than such magazines. It is natural that there are such magazines as long as there is science for the sake of it or for another purpose. They click on the name and remain unfocused.</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>Some practical tips for publishing an article in English</strong></p> <p dir="auto">My first tip: know your field or narrow topic from the inside out. To do this, before writing your article, carefully study what others have written about it. Find your corner.</p> <p dir="auto">My next important tip: practice writing in English. You may have a high score in IELs Writing, but that alone may not be enough to write a paper. Show your writing to people you know, listen to advice and criticism, and incorporate it into your manuscript.</p> <p dir="auto">Last tip: Don't come empty-handed. Writing an article will not be easy, publishing it will be even more difficult. But publishing an article in a good journal is extremely beneficial in an academic career. Publishing one article in some journals is almost equivalent to writing an entire book. Writing a good article is an art.</p> <p dir="auto">I'll leave a link to two articles I've published, though it's rude. Both of these are open access, meaning no library membership is required. I wrote the first one myself, and the second one in collaboration.</p> <p dir="auto">1. Comparative analysis of the attitude of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China towards the Japanese under their control.</p> <p dir="auto">2. About the fate of Japanese prisoners of war who returned from the Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War.</p> <p dir="auto"><strong>About the author:</strong> <em>Sherzod Mominov works as an associate professor at the Faculty of History of the University of East Anglia, Great Britain.
