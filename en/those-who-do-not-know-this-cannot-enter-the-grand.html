                The most relevant message in the field of education today is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>There are 3 factors for the realization of goals: The goal should be clear; Let your goal be reliable; Aim for many people in your goal, don't be a greedy person who only thinks about yourself!</strong><br/><strong>There is a bitter rule in psychology: intending to earn money is the first step towards poverty... Applicants should not make the intention and prayer only for themselves.</strong><br/><strong>Why do you think so?</strong><br/><hr/> <p>People are guided by goals. Undoubtedly, one of the important factors that encourage us to act and make us mature in the future is a correctly set goal. But not always our goals are realized. In such situations, we keep on agreeing to what he said, "I asked for the mountain and I reached the shore." In fact, due to a small mistake or negligence, we will lose a lot of things. Below we share the recommendations of our teacher Ahadjon Koshakov, a qualified psychologist, read and learn how to set the right goal! don't be a self-centered miser!  <p>If you can use these three "formulas" correctly and apply them in your life, your dreams and goals will come true 100%!</p> <p>Let's talk about you. Your goal is clear: to study; confidence is also clear: access to the grant; but in the third, many are a little greedy. There is an aspect of human nature that we all always live by "be myself", "be me first, then others". Now that we are studying, even when we enter a university, after graduation, we will buy a good plot, buy a car, travel the world, buy a villa, a dacha... But...</p> <p>Many people forget the third "formula". If you know, the main goal in business is not to make money. Their main goal is to please customers and ease people's burdens. I'm not talking about small boutiques, I'm talking about big brands! There is also a bitter rule in psychology: <strong>intending to earn money is the first step towards poverty...</strong></p> <p>Applicants should not make intentions and prayers only for themselves. Make the intention right, pray objectively, ask God not only for yourself, but for the future of the whole community, the nation. Let's say you want to become an accomplished teacher? In the future, intend to train good students, share the light of knowledge with the souls in darkness, do scientific work and benefit your country. it is not a matter of his intentions to realize his dreams in full and beautiful condition!</p> <p>Don't forget, to be rich, to sit in a position, God will give you within seconds. Sometimes you don't even notice it, how many people in the world have become famous overnight! He gives, even more than you ask and expect. It is enough if you have the right intention, manage it correctly, and not lose yourself!</p> <p>Confidence is also a very important factor here. Tell me, are you 50% sure you'll get into the grand right now? A labbai?! 90% sure you say? Remember, the remaining 10% will increase and increase as your exam date approaches. <strong>"What if I can't get in?" "What will I be if I fall?" You think, "How can I stand up in my neighborhood?"</strong> and so on. This is your biggest mistake.</p> <p>Most of the applicants we talked to say that they think a lot about failing their studies, and these thoughts do not give them peace. When he is going towards his goal, he has fears that he will not reach his goal, that he will be ashamed, that he will not be able to score, that he will ask questions that he does not know, he will either not reach his goal, or he will not be able to achieve the result that he thought and expected. These thoughts break the applicant before he gets to the exam and put him in a dead end...</p> <p>In fact, there is no obstacle. As some cartoons say, <strong>the secret of the magic ingredient is that there is no secret.</strong> We can create and make our own dragons in our imaginations. Then we have to study and start to fight with it. This is the biggest mistake! So, what should be done?</p> <p>There is a law of intentions in psychology. The more you think about falling, the closer it will come to you and the more it will happen. There is a saying that the angel says amen to both good and bad words. Don't feel bad about yourself and your future. So <strong>be careful when you make an intention, it has the ability to come true!</strong></p> <p>What should you do if a bad dream comes to your mind? For example, you began to worry about what will happen if I fail to study. It is the first thought that comes to your mind. It gets into your heart, creates feelings of insecurity and doubt, and you begin to feel stressed. Why do you need such a headache?</p> <p>You can turn a bad suspicion into a good one without letting it into your heart! Let's say you had a bad dream while you were studying, and you need to replace it with a good news in your room. In psychology, thought transference means that when you think about someone, that person is also thinking about you. It is called the connection of the brain to the brain, and it has been scientifically proven.</p> <p>Recently, one of our applicants said that if she reads a book during the day, she gets distracted a lot and understands better in the morning. Why do you think so? The reason is that in the morning we are calm, calm, and our brain is in a "fresh" state, you probably thought so too. <strong>This is not true!</strong> Even in medicine, they say that the brain receives information better because it rests until morning. In fact, because the people who disturb your brain with sending thoughts are sleeping in the morning, the information in the book will stay in your memory better. <strong>You won't be distracted in the morning, because the people who give halal have not woken up yet!</strong></p> <p>Another tip for applicants: wake up before the sun in the morning! Most of our applicants studied until 2-3 in the evening and fell asleep in the morning. Know that the morning subhidam is a blessed time when whatever one asks God for will come true. There is a saying: "People who sleep until 8-9 in the morning should not think at all about luck and success." This is not my point, our Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) also said to bless the morning of my ummah, so wake up in the morning, you can sleep a little after sunrise.</p> <p>Rumi has a story about sheep and dogs. Sheep give birth to 3 lambs in one year. Although millions of sheep are slaughtered for their meat every year, their number on earth has not decreased. Why do you say that sheep wake up early in the morning? In that story, it was mentioned that dogs give birth to 5-6 dogs 2-3 times in a year, and because they growl in the evening and fall asleep in the morning, their sustenance is low. Don't stop moving, set a goal, set the right intention, and move forward. You will definitely achieve your dream! <br/><br/>Source: prepared based on the information of the oliygoh.uz website. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/6/6-sinf-adabiyot-1-qism" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p></p>
