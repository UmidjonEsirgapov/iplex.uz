                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>678 applicants become students without a test. Applicants with a national or international certificate have a privilege. </strong><br/><strong>Procedure of exemption from the test based on the certificate. Privileged applicants are exempted from the tests in accordance with the law if they have a CEFR, IELTS, SAT, TOEFL, GMAT, or national certificate in the relevant subjects.</strong><br/><strong>This allows them to immediately go to the selection stage.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>678 applicants are students without a test</h2> <h3>Applicants with national or international certificates are privileged</h3> <p>According to the official statement of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, in 2025, 678 applicants won the right to become students directly without taking tests. The reason for this is that they have a nationally or internationally recognized certificate in all subjects.</p> <h3>Exemption from the test based on the certificate</h3> <p>Eligible applicants are exempted from testing in accordance with the law if they have a CEFR, IELTS, SAT, TOEFL, GMAT, or national certificate in the relevant subjects. This allows them to immediately go to the selection stage.</p> <p>This process is controlled by the DTM (State Test Center) and the Ministry of Higher Education.</p> <h3>The number of those who passed directly to the selection stage is increasing</h3> <p>Every year, the number of applicants using this privilege is increasing. This situation is not only an opportunity for educated youth, but also reduces the burden on the test system. In order to motivate students, the role of certificates is increasing.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>678 applicants who are students without tests in 2025 is a realistic result of a knowledge-based approach. If you also have a national or international certificate, it will give you a big advantage.
