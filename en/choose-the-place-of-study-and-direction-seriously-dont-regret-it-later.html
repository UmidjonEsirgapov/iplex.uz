                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Dear applicants, you are asked to make a choice with serious responsibility.</strong><br/><strong> ✅ Wherever you intend to study, apply now. submit an application to one of the directions.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2><strong>Applicants, do not hope for a favor - make the right decision now!</strong></h2> <p>Dear applicants, you are requested to <strong>make a choice with serious responsibility</strong>. Every year, thousands of applicants get into trouble because of the <strong>"get in now, I'll do it later"</strong> approach.</p> <h3>⚠️ The most common mistake: Applying to the wrong major</h3> <p>For example: applying to <strong>Fruit and Viticulture</strong> and intending to <strong>become a doctor</strong> later is <strong>creepy</strong>. Both fields are <strong>completely different fields</strong> and <strong>transition between them is almost impossible</strong>.</p> <h3>🎯 What to do?</h3> <p> ✅ <strong>Wherever you intend to study, apply right now.</strong></p> <p> ✅ If you want to be a <strong>doctor</strong>, <strong>serious prepare</strong> and apply to <strong>one of the medical departments</strong>.</p> <p> ✅ <strong>Choose an area that is convenient for you.</strong> Then you won't have to struggle and go to my parents saying "make a baby to my parents".</p> <p><strong>No one is forcing you</strong> - the decision is yours. But it is also your duty to approach the decision <strong>responsibly</strong>.</p> <h3>❌ Why should you not trust the perevod?</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Perevod is not always allowed</p> </li> <li> <p>Directions and forms of education may not be suitable</p> </li> <li> <p>Each case is considered by the state commission</p> </li> <li> <p>Many applicants are being rejected — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/namanganda-namangan-davlat-texnika-universiteti-ochiladi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> </li> </ul> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
