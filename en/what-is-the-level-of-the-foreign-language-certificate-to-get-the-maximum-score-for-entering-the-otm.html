                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>If the foreign language certificate of the applicant applying for the bachelor's level is B2, he will be given the maximum score from the foreign language blog. It is necessary.</strong><br/><strong>We remind you that since last year's admission, since the requirement of a foreign language certificate for master's degree and further education began for the first time, admissions were held twice in one year, and applicants with certificates below the appropriate level were also admitted. As the admission approaches, applicants have more and more questions. One of such questions is about what level of certificate should be in order to get the maximum score in the foreign language subject in the exam. <p>If the applicant applying for the bachelor's level of education has a foreign language certificate B2, he will be given the maximum score in the foreign language blog. Certificates lower than that, for example B1 certificate, are not accepted.</p> <p>An applicant with a B2 certificate from a foreign language will be given maximum points. For example, if English is the applicant's first subject, then 93.0 points, if it is the second subject, 63.0 points.</p> <p><strong>What kind of certificates should be?</strong></p> <p>for English language — IELs 5.5, Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL IBT 72), Cambridge Assessment English FCE, Cambridge Assessment Linguaskill international examination systems or national English examination system certificates if available, B2 level;</p> <ul> <li>for Japanese language — national certificate or Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT No. 2) language proficiency levels B2 and higher;</li> <li>for German language — national certificate or Goethe-Zertifikat, Deutsches Sprachdiplom (DSD), Test Deutsch als Fremdsprache (Test DAF) international language proficiency levels B2 and higher;</li> <li>French language for - national certificate or Diplôme d'Etudes en Langue Française (DELF), Test de Connaissance du Française (TCF4) language proficiency levels B2 and higher according to international examination systems;</li> <li>for other languages - language proficiency levels B2 and higher according to national certificate or international examination systems.</li> </ul> <p><strong>How many points can I get even by submitting a lower level certificate?</strong></p> <p>Is it possible? no. The reason is that when the certificate information is uploaded to the online platform, the Knowledge and Skills Assessment Agency checks the validity and level of each of them.</p> <p>For example, during last year's admission, more than 29,000 foreign language certificates were uploaded by the applicants, and 955 of them were found not to meet the requirements.</p> <p>And 56 certificates were forged by the applicants themselves. The former State Test Center (now the Agency for Assessment of Knowledge and Skills) appealed to law enforcement agencies about such certificates. Therefore, it is better not to think about falsifying the certificate at all.</p> <p><strong>What about the master's degree?</strong></p> <p>For applying for the master's degree of higher education institutions, a foreign language certificate is made mandatory. That is, if the applicant does not have a foreign language certificate, he will not even be able to submit a document. In this case, the certificate level for philology education should be at least C1, and for all other education areas, it should be B2.</p> <p>Recently, the list of foreign language certificates accepted for master's degree (with level) was published recently. A total of 25 types of certificates in 10 languages ​​are included in the list.</p> <p>We remind you that since last year's admission, since the requirement of a foreign language certificate for master's degree and further education began for the first time, admissions were held twice in one year, and applicants with a certificate below the appropriate level were also admitted to study. Only they are required to have a required foreign language certificate before the end of their studies. Otherwise, the diploma will not be issued.</p> <p>However, according to the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, this was an exception only for last year's admission. From this year, the requirement for a certificate will be strict. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kimlar-kirish-imtihoni-uchun-tolov-qilmaydi-toliq-royxat" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources..</strong>
