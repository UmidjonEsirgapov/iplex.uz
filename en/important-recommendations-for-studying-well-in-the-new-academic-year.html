But sometimes there are problems with good mastery. You need to look for and find ways to improve your mood and study effectively. Here are 5 recommendations for a <strong>calm</strong> and successful study.</p> <h4>1. Prepare well</h4> <p>You have to trust your knowledge. If the preparation is good, the level of <strong>calmness</strong> will also increase. Therefore, always be ready to study and prepare lessons. This will help you feel confident and not nervous before exams or tests.</p> <h4>2. Take breaks</h4> <p>Take breaks from lesson preparation to reduce any stress. This will give you the opportunity to devote time to your favorite activities. Not much, a <strong>half hour</strong> break can improve your productivity. For example, watch your favorite movies, cook something or go for a walk.</p> <h4>3. Proper breathing</h4> <p>The respiratory system can accelerate during nervousness and excitement. <strong>Slow and deep breathing</strong> helps calm the nervous system. Therefore, do not forget to do breathing exercises and calm yourself down.</p> <h4>4. Sleep well</h4> <p><strong>Sleep well</strong> is one of the most important factors for effective study. The amount and quality of sleep improves brain activity and helps the body to be refreshed. Therefore, know your sleep schedule and follow it.</p> <h4>5. Believe in yourself</h4> <p>Most importantly, build <strong>confidence</strong> in yourself and use all your potential without being lazy. You can definitely be a student this year! — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/darsliklar/6/6-sinf-texnologiya" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
