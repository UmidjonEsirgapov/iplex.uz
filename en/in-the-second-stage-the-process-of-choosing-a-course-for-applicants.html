                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Choosing a course: Applicants choose up to five courses.</strong><br/><strong>You can find out in which course there are part-time, evening, distance courses or not when the quotas are released. grant, 25 grants to UzMU, 20 grants to QarDU, etc.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>What will the applicant choose in the second stage of the exam?</strong></p> <p>A number of changes and additions have been made to the admission processes this year. Exams for the 2024-2025 academic year are being held in the order of <strong>"First the test, then the selection"</strong>. The first stage of the exams will end on July 25. After that, 15 days will be allocated for the second stage - the competition. After the formation of the general mandate, the final results will be announced within a week.</p> <p>At the second stage, the applicant will choose the following:</p> <p><strong>1. Choice of course:</strong> Applicants choose up to five courses. In this case, he can choose any directions and any HEIs that correspond to the set of subjects he passed the test. Important! You can change the route you chose during registration. On the UzBMB site, it is possible to choose a direction, not a complex of subjects. In this way, applicants are given the opportunity to find out which courses they can enter through elective subjects.</p> <p><strong>2. Choosing the form of education:</strong> Applicants choose the form of education. In this case, depending on the allocated place in the quota, it is possible to choose <strong>daytime, part-time, evening or remote form</strong>. Or you can choose a mix of five directions. For example, 1 and 2 are daytime, 3 is part-time, 4 is evening, and 5 is remote. You can find out when the quotas are released in which course there is a part-time, evening, or distance course. But the quotas have not been confirmed yet.</p> <p><strong>3. Selection of Selection Priority:</strong> Applicants will also select a <strong>selection priority</strong> during the selection process. In this case, the selection priority can be focused either on the state grant or on the direction. If the applicant selects **"Grant priority"**, his selection results will be considered first on the basis of the grant and then on the basis of the contract. If he chooses a field other than "grant priority" or **"grant and payment-contract"**, he participates in the competition based on grants and contracts in each field and is considered to have enrolled in his first chosen field even if it is a contract. is separated. For example, there will not be a specific grant quota for the University of Journalism and Mass Communications of Uzbekistan, but a general grant quota will be allocated for the internet journalism course. </p> <p>In this case, among the applicants who applied to the internet journalism course in all universities of the republic, those who scored the highest points within the quota, regardless of which university they applied to, will receive the grant. This means that some universities may no longer have any students who have received a grant.</p> <p><strong>As an example:</strong> This year, 115 grant quotas have been allocated for the field of Internet journalism. For example, let's say that UzJoku, UzMU, UzDJTU, TDSHU and QarDU have an online journalism course. All the applicants who applied to the internet journalism course of these 5 universities will be ranked in the order of scores and 115 applicants with the highest scores will be awarded a grant. Then, for example, 50 grants to UzJoku, 25 grants to UzMU, 20 grants to QarDU, etc. may be correct.</p> <p><strong>In the new system:</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/aqsh-ayrim-bakalavr-dasturlari-uchun-qisman-moliyalashtirilgan-grantlar" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <ul> <li>A grant will be given to applicants who applied to a certain course and received high marks without giving a grant to each university.</li> <li>Applicants will not know the results of the other applicants who took the exam from the course as in previous admissions. That is, the general results will not be announced until the mandate is issued. An applicant can go to the Mandat.uz site of the Knowledge Assessment Agency, study the passing scores of applicants for grants and contracts for the last 3 years, and choose a course based on the results.</li> </ul> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
