                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Super-contract: If you cannot get a passing score, transfer of studies is allowed based on the terms of the super-contract. It is necessary to clarify.</strong><br/><strong>A written application addressed to the rector or through the electronic system available in the Higher Education Institution: To transfer a direction, faculty, form of education or language within the Higher Education Institution of one country.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>According to the Presidential Decree No. PQ-279 signed on June 15, 2022, the procedure for transferring studies in higher education institutions (HEIs) throughout the Republic of Uzbekistan is established. Below, according to this decision, the main rules and conditions of the transfer process are presented.</p> <h3>1. Transfer of Study from One State Higher Education Institution to Another State Higher Education Institution</h3> <p>Transfer of studies from the State Higher Education Institution to another State Higher Education Institution is allowed only in two situations:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Move to Spouse</strong>: If the student has started a family and wants to transfer to the higher education institution in the area where the spouse permanently resides.</li> <li><strong>Civil Servant Relocation</strong>: If a civil servant moves to another region for work and his spouse or minor child wishes to transfer his education to that region (on the basis of a letter from the ministry of employment).</li> </ul> <p>In other cases, internal transfer (transfer of education from one region to another region or to another higher education institution within the region) is not allowed.</p> <h3>2. Transferring Studies from Abroad</h3> <p>The following conditions are maintained for transferring studies from abroad to HEIs of Uzbekistan:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Test or Creative Exam</strong>: It is required to pass a test or creative exam in a suitable and related field and collect a passing score. <ul> <li>Passing scores for 2023.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Super-contract</strong>: If you do not get a passing score, you can transfer your studies based on the terms of the super-contract.</li> <li><strong>Incompatible Courses</strong>: It is not allowed to transfer your studies from abroad to a course that is not compatible and similar. <ul> <li>List of related courses in 2023.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>After the test, the documents of each student will be checked again. If someone has prepared a fake document stating that he is "studying abroad", the results will be canceled and the prosecutor's office will be referred.</p> <h3>3. Transferring Studies from Foreign and Non-State Higher Education Institutions in Uzbekistan</h3> <p>In this case, the procedure of the previous year is preserved:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Test or Creative Exam</strong>: A test or creative exam is submitted to a suitable and similar field and a passing score is required. <ul> <li>2023 passing scores.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Super-contract</strong>: Transfer of studies is allowed based on the terms of the super-contract if unable to obtain a passing score.</li> <li><strong>Ineligible Majors</strong>: Transfer of studies is possible by paying a one-time super-contract for eligible and non-eligible majors. <ul> <li>List of related destinations in 2023.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>4. Transfer of Studies from State HEIs to Non-State HEIs</h3> <p>The process of transferring studies from State HEIs to Non-State HEIs is not controlled by the state. This process is carried out by non-state HEIs according to their own independent rules. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify whether the studies can be transferred from the HEI itself.</p> <h3>5. Transfer of studies from non-state higher education institution to non-state higher education institution</h3> <p>This process is also not controlled by the state, and the procedure should be clarified from the non-state higher educational institution that is to be transferred.</p> <h3>6. Transferring Studies from Abroad to Non-State OTM</h3> <p>The process of transferring studies from abroad to non-state OTM is also not controlled by the state. This process is based on rules independently determined by non-governmental HEIs.</p> <h3>7. Transfer from one direction or faculty to another within one State Higher Education Institution</h3> <p>This process is decided by the rector of Higher Education Institution. The application is written in the name of the rector and cannot be made through the sites transfer.edu.uz or my.uzbmb.uz. In this case, the appropriateness and type of the route to be transferred, the reason for the transfer, and the possibilities of OTM can be taken into account.</p> <h3>8. Changing the Form or Language of Education in a HEI</h3> <p>This issue is also decided by the HEI administration. When changing the form or language of education, the possibilities of HEIs, for example, the capacity of the auditorium and the number of professors and teachers, are taken into account. For example, although it is almost impossible to transfer from part-time to full-time, it is easier to transfer from full-time to part-time.</p> <h3>Application Acceptance System</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Transfer.edu.uz</strong>: To transfer from one HEI to another HEI of the Republic or within one HEI.</li> <li><strong>My.uzbmb.uz</strong>: Foreign and non-governmental To transfer from HEIs to state HEIs.</li> <li><strong>Written application addressed to the rector or through the electronic system available in HEIs</strong>: To transfer a direction, faculty, form of education or language within one state HEI.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Application period</strong>: from July 15 to August 5 (also on this day). — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/yaponiya-bakalavr-va-magistratura-talabalari-uchun-qiymati-taxminan-910-aqsh-dollari-miqdorida-oylik-stipendiya" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <h3>Required Documents:</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Application</strong> (online);</li> <li><strong>Transcript or scorebook</strong> (JPEG or PDF format);</li> <li><strong>Academic reference</strong> (for returning students).</li> </ul> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
