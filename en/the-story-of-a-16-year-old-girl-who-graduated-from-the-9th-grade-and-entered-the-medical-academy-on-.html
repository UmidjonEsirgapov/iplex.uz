                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>However, it is interesting that the DTM base accepted the 9th grade certificate of 16-year-old Nafisa and she entered the Tashkent Medical Academy on the basis of a state grant. (eleven-year education), secondary special (nine-year basic secondary and two-year secondary special education), primary professional education (nine-year basic secondary and two-year primary professional education), as well as persons who received secondary special, vocational education (nine-year general secondary and three-year secondary special, vocational education) before the entry into force of this Law the right to receive higher education is determined.</strong><br/><strong>In this, the online registration system of the State Test Center for applicants is integrated with the information systems of the Ministry of Public Education and the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education, and the information of the graduates of the current year on the educational institution they graduated from is obtained in real time from the information systems of the ministries," he said. It is noted that Nafisa Ravshanova registered online on June 28, 2022 through the website of the State Test Center my.dtm.uz, and when the personal number on the ID card was entered into the system for registration, her passport information was received from the State Personalization Center, and information about the educational institution she graduated from the Ministry of Public Education in real time.</strong><br/><hr/> <h4>It is not possible to take the DTM exam without graduating from the 11th grade of high school or academic lyceum. But interestingly, the DTM base accepted the 9th grade certificate of 16-year-old Nafisa and she entered the Tashkent Medical Academy on the basis of a state grant.</h4> <p>Nafisa Ravshanova told Kun.uz how impossible things are, her dreams of neurosurgery and genetics, and how to enter the medical university with the highest "walking" score in a short period of time.</p> <p>Nafisa was born in Kyziltepa district of Navoi region. He completed the 9th grade in the 2021/22 academic year. She has been attending a tutor since the 8th grade, and is still studying.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.kun.uz/source/8/_ka88oQRCpoODlSNxiz8If8Bi3783WBi.jpg"/>From the personal archive of Nafisa Ravshanova</p> <p>"At the moment, I am a 1st-year student of the academic lyceum at the Tashkent Pediatric Medical Institute. Last year, when I graduated from the 8th grade, a student who goes to tutoring with me gave it to me to test himself. He entered on the basis of a contract, but did not study. At that time, I thought that I would try to finish the 9th grade and apply for studies. But I told my parents that I would apply for school and got the ID card earlier on April 25. When I graduated from the 9th grade, they gave me a certificate not with my birth certificate, but with my ID card information. In July, I entered my ID card information when applying online.</p> <p>As soon as I entered my ID card information in the place where it says "Enter your certificate information", my certificate information also appeared. I went on and on. I chose 5 medical higher education institutions - the first one was the field of treatment of the Tashkent Medical Academy. I chose this university because I wanted to study at the Medical Academy.</p> <p>The base accepted my documents without telling me that I entered the wrong number or that the certificate was not acceptable. It was good for me to apply online as it was obvious that I would not be accepted with my 9th grade certificate if the documents were taken offline. Exam dates were announced, and I was given permission to take the test.</p> <p>True, this was not legally correct, but the base should have been perfect, not accept the 9th grade certificate, right?! So, I said that there is a chance and continued on my way.</p> <p><strong>"I entered the scholarship with 178.4 points"</strong></p> <p>On August 9, I entered the exam and passed the exam in two main subjects - chemistry and biology, as well as 3 compulsory subjects. The test results came out the day after the exam, and I scored 178.4 points. But after the mandate is issued, it will be clear whether I entered or not. I waited with hope.</p> <p>The mandate was issued on August 27 - I received an SMS saying <strong>You have been recommended for studentship at the Tashkent Medical Academy on the basis of a state grant</strong>. I left very happy. Because I didn't believe that I would enter at first. I got into my intended studies in my first attempt. I thought that I should take advantage of this opportunity, and I didn't want to leave because I didn't have the opportunity. on August 31, we came to Tashkent to apply for the lyceum - my father, sister and I. We went to the first university and were told that without a certificate of 11th grade, we will not be accepted, and without a certificate, a diploma of higher education will not be awarded. They gave a good understanding. After that, I went to the lyceum and submitted my documents.</p> <p>This year, after the holidays ended until September 5 due to the holiday, we started the action from that day - we wrote an appeal to the president, the Senate of the Oliy Majlis and a letter to the Minister of Higher Education Abduqadir Tashkulov. The main reason for the application was to be allowed to study.</p> <p>Even though I finished the 9th grade, I did not enter by guesswork, behind this result lies my 2 years of knowledge. After all, I studied and prepared myself.</p> <p>If we look at the statistics, more than 50 percent of the applicants did not even get a passing score. Did they also study 11 years of education or secondary special education?! If these 11 years of study were to solve something, we would have seen the proof of it in the statistics.</p> <p>I would have asked them to give me a chance now, would I have spent these 2 years learning the language... Anyway, I am going to study at the lyceum, because I don't want to forget what I know until the time comes to apply.</p> <p><strong>"My teachers and I published a book, I am a problem "</strong></p> <p>In the 9th grade, I took the first place in the city stage and the 2nd place in the regional stage in biology. Last year, together with my biology teacher, we published a collection for applicants and teachers called "A collection of problems from molecular biology and bioenergetics". My main task was to create a problem. The base was formed by my teacher. The book was started by my teacher's student, for some reason, they went to Tashkent, and I finished the rest of the book. I chose neurosurgery, a common and not so well-known field. My goal is to develop this field, rather than just becoming a doctor, I want to do science in my chosen direction.</p> <p>Becoming a neurosurgery doctor is not easy, because treating brain tumors or diseases related to the nervous system requires much higher knowledge, strength and responsibility. You will have to study a lot and work on yourself. I intend to create innovations in science. I intend to do research in bioengineering and genetics as soon as I improve my knowledge of neurosurgery without getting stuck in one direction.</p> <p>But I think that I should study abroad for that. Because these directions are not very developed in Uzbekistan. Even if they exist, they talk about the achievements of the 20th century. But I hardly saw the implementation of the achievements made in recent years.</p> <p><strong>"The fact that my parents left the choice to us ensured our success". First of all, I am grateful to God for giving me intelligent parents who understand and support me, who think beyond the stereotypes that "girls don't need to study". They never once said that you will choose this profession.</strong></p> <p>We achieved the result because they left the choice to us and we loved studying our chosen field. No limits were set for my sister either, she chose the direction she wanted and entered the financial institution.</p> <p>I received all material and spiritual support from my parents. We are the reflection of our parents, the reflection of the upbringing they gave us.</p> <p>There are 3 girls in our family - we were never told that we don't have to study because we are girls, or that our studies were not taken lightly. In our family, children are not separated into boys or girls, my parents talk to us from a human point of view. That is, they don't differentiate according to the concepts that a girl should be like that and a boy should be like that. I respect these qualities and the upbringing they gave me. If I have any shortcomings, I consider them my own, and my achievements belong to my parents.</p> <p>Nafisa does not forget the teachers who taught her.</p> <blockquote> <p>"I think that my biology teacher Narzulla Kadyrov and my chemistry teacher Dilshod Norkulov have worked hard to achieve such results in 2 years. I have always been grateful to them," he says.</p> </blockquote> <p>We wished Nafisa success in her future studies and said goodbye. One of his words is very important in our opinion: "If studying for 11 years at school solves something, we would have seen the proof of it in the enrollment statistics". We contacted the DTM press service regarding questions such as what he did, whether he can't study even though he enrolled. Jamshidbek Odilov, chief specialist of the Ministry of Education, explained about this.</p> <p>"Persons who received general secondary (eleven-year education), secondary special (nine-year basic secondary and two-year secondary special education), primary professional education (nine-year basic secondary and two-year primary professional education) according to the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan "On Education", as well as this Law Before its entry into force, persons who have received secondary special, vocational education (nine-year general secondary and three-year secondary special, vocational education) have the right to receive higher education.</p> <p>Therefore, when registering online for admission to higher education institutions, applicants must have general secondary education (on the basis of the 11th grade) or secondary special, enter the document information about graduation from a vocational educational institution into the system and, if recommended to the student, submit the original of this document with an attachment to the higher educational institution.</p> <p>In this, the online registration system of the State Test Center for applicants is integrated with the information systems of the Ministry of Public Education and the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education, and the information on the educational institution of the graduates of the current year is provided by the ministries it is obtained from the information systems in real time," he says.</p> <p>It is noted that Nafisa Ravshanova registered online through the my.dtm.uz website of the State Test Center on June 28, 2022. When the personal number on the ID card was entered into the system for registration, her passport information was received from the State Personalization Center, and information about the educational institution she graduated from the Ministry of Public Education in real time. </p> <p>"In this case, the information of Nafisa Ravshanova is presented from the information system of the Ministry of Public Education as a graduate of this year. For this reason, Nafisa Ravshanova was registered as an applicant and it was decided that she would participate in the tests," explains Odilov.</p> <p><strong>Madina Ochilova.
