                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>The most important thing is the teaching about man.</strong><br/><strong>And what method do you use to teach this subject in an easy and understandable way?</strong><br/><strong>I mainly have students whose first subject is biology.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Biology studies nature, the world of flora and fauna surrounding us, micro and macro organisms. Most importantly, it is a teaching about man. Yes, you and I are considered biological beings from the point of view of science. How interesting is it for a person to learn and apply himself?</p> <p>Today, the number of applicants studying biology has increased significantly. The number of young people interested in biology in our country is increasing day by day. However, the majority of schoolchildren view biology as a complex subject and have difficulty learning and mastering it. So, the reason for this is the teacher's lack of pedagogical skills or the students' failure to study? In general, is it possible to organize a biology lesson in an easy and understandable language, interestingly?</p> <p>Now, with these and other questions, we turn to Nodir aka Oljayev, an experienced teacher who has been training students in biology for nearly 15 years, senior teacher of the "Registon" educational center, leader of biology teachers in the educational center. Thank you, the interview is waiting for you!</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/4/1100__W5eFBoZeMGsMLma00pW-3JjUqsA4qAqi.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>- What subject do applicants who study biology have difficulty mastering? And what method do you use to teach this subject in an easy and understandable way?</strong></p> <p>– In many places, biology is taught in a traditional question-and-answer format. This is a really effective method. However, most students get tired of the question-and-answer session, their brains get strained, and the level of boredom increases. In addition to this method, I also use methods that enrich students' imagination and expand their worldview.</p> <p>For example, I encourage my students to express the situations presented in sentences through various pictures, because biology is the external world, the existence in which we live. If you imagine every living thing in it, you will quickly learn the information, besides, the lesson process will be more interesting. You or other applicants may not have heard of the Smart Scheme. We invented this term ourselves. A smart scheme is a process of expressing concepts, topics, processes, laws in the form of a scheme, hiding some part of it, leaving it down and finding it together with my applicants. Later, such schemes are prepared by the students themselves, this method in the form of a game is both effective and adds energy to the lesson. Because people differ from each other down to their fingerprints, the level of mastery and intelligence are the same. Let's say that if the topic of plants is difficult for you, it will be your friend's favorite topic. That's why I try to explain all topics as creatively and interestingly as possible, to organize lesson processes in an unusual way. It has been very useful during my many years of experience.</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/4/1100__5VP5Vbjjs8XhTma7Ta-c0-Pk23tAwIFB.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>- Biology 1 block, that is, how can young people who are not the main subject do well in the exam? That is, is it possible to get good grades even though the main focus is not entirely on this subject? </strong></p> <p>- Today there are very few fields where biology is not the main science. Frankly, I haven't trained a student with biology as a second subject in recent years. I mainly have students whose first subject is biology. But sometimes the above situation is also observed, for example, in some areas of the pharmaceutical field, biology is considered a second science. Biology used to be the 2nd subject in chemistry, but now it has been replaced by mathematics.</p> <p>However, I would not divide subjects into majors or minors. Because the applicant who thinks that this subject will give me low marks, even if I don't master it well, is most likely wrong. On the contrary, as they say, live every day as if it were your last, a person who studies every subject as if it were the first block, the main subject, will definitely show good results. This science will help him someday, his hard work and sleepless nights will pay off. The important thing is to try sincerely, the rest will happen gradually...</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/4/1100__ywSGpcJv830bEkw20hDcl0QFAxbDOTJz.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>- If you share your unique aspects in teaching biology. Why should applicants choose you, the "Registon" educational center?</strong></p> <p>- I have a method that stands out from others. This is vocabulary building. If the applicant who has just come to the class is starting his preparation from 0, I will list every plant, animal, microorganism, law and term. Yes, I do not melt! This is important in the formation of bioterms in the mind of the applicant.</p> <p>We ask every biology teacher at the "Registon" educational center to stay away from traditional methods and rigid teaching methods. While my students start reading books only after the terms are memorized, other teachers have their own unusual methods. These methods greatly help to achieve faster results, to form a biological base in the brain.</p> <p>You may ask why is this necessary? I personally believe that each teacher should be different from others with his methods and pedagogical experience. It is necessary and necessary for the teacher to have his own methods, which have been tested and give good results. If you come to "Registon", we will tell you the rest during the lesson!</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/4/1100__ctF52bYwGjTMR9zgoaxC88iR9uG_q0Fm.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>- Why did you choose "Registon" to teach? What keeps you here?</strong></p> <p>- You know, I have been working at "Registan" for more than a year. I like the atmosphere here, the team, and most importantly, the high purpose of the teachers. Every teacher here works to bring Uzbekistan's education to the first place in the world. You see, there are people among us who are moving towards tasks that few people can even imagine. I am always proud to work in such a great mission, to be a member of such a team. God willing, you will start to see the results soon. It is the mission, the main idea of ​​our educational center that keeps me in "Registon"!</p> <p>Remember, if your intention is impartial, on the path of goodness, your work will only and only go forward. You will find time in any situation, time will appear in time. Although I am currently on a trip to Turkey, I am talking to my colleagues at "Registan" and regularly helping them in their work. I don't feel tired at all, I enjoy it again! After I return to my homeland, we will start classes again...</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/4/1100__9mbkTnSbRb2YKFTMvLIfS-EEUfjeW_Wv.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>- What recommendations do you give to applicants so that they can get good results in biology and have bright faces in the exam? If you share your tips…</strong></p> <p>– No hard work goes in vain, including studying biology with all your heart, if you put in more effort and work than others, you will see the results someday. After all, biology is the science of yourself and your surroundings! Anyway, don't be discouraged because I am studying a lot, the rower is studying less, I am not getting good results, and the rower is the opposite... Ask God, don't stop trying. If you study and study sincerely, you will definitely achieve your goal. What can you give as a motivation for those who are at the beginning of the road to start preparing now without losing time?</p> <p>- I have worked with such applicants a lot, and if you believe, I worked with them this year as well. I think that the main reason for their hesitation is that they are just entering the field of biology. You have not yet entered science, it is natural to have such thoughts. My advice is that you should slowly build your biological outlook. How will it be? For example, what is the difference between a wild plant and a cultivated plant? A non-biologist would say that a wild plant grows in the field and a cultivated plant is cultivated by humans. For those who think biologically, wild plants can grow, develop and reproduce without human intervention, and it is called a species; Plants that can't live without human intervention, or that are created by humans, are cultural and they are treated as varieties.</p> <p>First of all, you should get interested in science and get into biology through these simple examples. Believe me, you just have to find the door and get into science, and then you will start living with biology! Because teachers often change the minds of applicants. Only after that, they get fully involved in the process, they read with no room for all kinds of questions in their brains. And the role of the teacher is invaluable in this!</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/4/1100__sUF5cFISyGQ6hIMENs9yOOD7yIyx-xMn.jpg"/></p> <p><strong>- Thank you for the interesting and useful conversation!</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/aqsh-bakalavr-bosqichida-oqish-uchun-toliq-moliyalashtirilgan-grant-dasturi-va-tadqiqotlar-uchun-12-000" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz website order..
