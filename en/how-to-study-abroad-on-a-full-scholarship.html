                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Although studying abroad requires a large budget from students, there have always been opportunities to save money in this budget in whole or in part. we will be able to get information.</strong><br/><strong>Basic requirements for getting a grant: Below are some basic requirements of each scholarship.</strong><br/><hr/> <p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone dreams of studying abroad, that is, in a country with high educational standards and high results. Unfortunately, it is not easy for many to achieve this dream due to the high cost of education in such countries. Although studying abroad requires a large budget from students, there have always been opportunities to save some or all of that budget. These opportunities are <strong>grants.</strong> Scholarships come in many varieties, ranging from needy student support programs to meritorious student awards, such as full and partial grants and educational scholarships, depending on the benefits offered. Their financing is mainly carried out by global organizations, governments and educational institutions, and in some cases by individuals.</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Finding grant programs:</strong></p> <p style="text-align: justify;">The process of finding grants that fully cover the costs of studying and living abroad for students is not easy. The first and foremost difficulty that students mostly face is that they remain unaware of the announcement of full scholarships. They don't know about a fully funded opportunity, or they find out about it after the closing date or deadline. Previously, there were only a few organizations or pages providing this type of information in Uzbek. But now there are several effective solutions for this problem and we will mention some of them below.</p> <p><strong>1. Internet Websites: </strong></p> <p>There are many <strong>websites</strong> such as <strong>www.oliygoh.uz</strong> which share such opportunities continuously from time to time. Applicants can also get information about such opportunities through the official websites of the foreign institution or the <strong>educational institutions</strong> where they are studying. For this, first of all, find out with which foreign organizations the organization you are studying is partnering with.</p> <p><strong>2. Winners or participants of the program:</strong></p> <p>It is natural that among our friends or acquaintances there are those who are studying abroad. It is through such people that we can not only find a grant program, but also get detailed information about the program in which they participated or received an award.</p> <p><strong>Basic requirements for receiving a grant:</strong><br/>Here are some basic requirements for each scholarship. Students should pay full attention to these aspects when applying for fully funded international scholarships. In most cases, these requirements include:</p> <ol> <li>Grant program special application or registration form;</li> <li>Motivation letter and Personal Statement/Statement of Purpose;</li> <li>Letters of recommendation;</li> <li>Official financial statements;</li> <li>Document confirming academic achievements (if available);</li> <li>Extracurricular activities academic achievement documents (if applicable);</li> <li>IELTS or GRE/SAT certificates (if applicable).</li> </ol> <p><strong>General eligibility criteria for scholarship programs:</strong></p> <p>Each scholarship has different eligibility criteria ranging from applicants' age to their citizenship. All grant opportunities always clearly state the criteria in their applications. Students should carefully read the eligibility options before applying for any scholarship. First of all, they should check their country. If the country is on the list of eligible countries, the next thing that the applicant should consider is the age limit. Some scholarship programs are only for women, some are for certain ethnic groups, and some are for all international students. So, before applying for any funded grant programs, one should know for sure whether one is eligible or not.</p> <p><strong>More details here</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/ikkinchi-va-undan-keyingi-talimni-olish-tartibi-tasdiqlandi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: Prepared based on information from oliygoh.uz.
