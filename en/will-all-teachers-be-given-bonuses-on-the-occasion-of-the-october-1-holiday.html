                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>It is known that in previous years, pedagogues could be incentivized during the year for their personal contributions to the development of general education institutions and high performance in their activities. </strong><br/><strong>According to the old practice, teachers were awarded with a monetary reward equal to 100% of the position salary based on their results. </strong><br/><hr/> <p>It is known that in previous years, pedagogic employees could be encouraged with a bonus amount equal to two position salaries during the year for their personal contributions to the development of general education institutions and high performance in their activities. This incentive was implemented several times from year to year.</p> <p>According to the old practice, teachers were awarded with a monetary bonus equal to 100% of the position salary based on their results. <strong>However, in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 425 of August 2, 2022, this regulation was amended.</strong></p> <p>Now, pedagogues of general education institutions, including management staff, <strong>only on the occasion of "October 1 - Teacher and Coach Day" equal to 50 percent of the minimum salary (currently 460 thousand soums). </strong></p> <p>It should be noted that the process of awarding all teachers on the occasion of the holiday is decided by the school director and economists and accountants of public education departments. <strong>Therefore, if there is no special instruction from higher organizations about awarding teachers on the occasion of the holiday, this issue may become difficult in practice</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kirish-imtihonlari-bekor-qilinishi-mumkin" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
