                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Many are asking when we should pay the remaining half if we pay 50%.</strong><br/><strong>That is: 75% - by April 1; 100% - until July 1.</strong><br/><strong>However, this 10% discount does not apply to a regular contract and to a super-contract on a scale of up to 4 points.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>According to the rule, those who want to study in a super-contract must first pay <strong>50%</strong> in order to receive an order on student admission. Those who entered into a normal contract can pay 25%.</p> <p>Usually they ask to pay half of the super-contract by September 15. However, due to the late confirmation of the contract and super-contract amounts and the late start of the application, <strong>this period should be extended</strong> (also in the case of a regular contract). They extend this term every year.</p> <p>Many people are asking when we should pay the other half if we pay 50%.</p> <p>The remaining 50% should be paid within the period set by the Rectors of Higher Education Institutions. Usually, these terms are the same as regular contract terms. That is:</p> <ul> <li>75% part - until April 1st;</li> <li>100% part - until July 1st.</li> </ul> <p>We remind you that if you cover the super-contract <strong>100%</strong> by October 15th, you will get a 10% discount. But this <strong>10% discount</strong> does not apply to a regular contract and a super-contract on a scale of up to 4 points. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/bakalavriat-turdosh-yonalishlar-royxati-elon-qilindi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.
