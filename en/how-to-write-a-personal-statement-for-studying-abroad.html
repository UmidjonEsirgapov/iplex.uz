                Important news for students and applicants.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>This is done through the Personal Statement essay that this article aims to cover.</strong><br/><strong>What is a Personal Statement?</strong><br/><strong>Relating your extracurricular interests to the course you are applying for will take your personal statement to the next level. </strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p> <p>Writing a compelling personal statement is an important part of the university application process and is a great way to improve your chances of being accepted.</p> <p>Before you can reap the amazing benefits of studying abroad, you need to convince the admissions committee that you are a good candidate for your dream university. This is done through the essay entitled "Personal Statement", which is intended to be covered by this article. Considering that there are few resources about this type of essay in the Uzbek language, the <strong>OLIYGOH.UZ</strong> team presents this article to students who intend to study abroad.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What is a Personal Statement?</strong></p> <p>A personal statement is a short essay that explains why you want to study at the university and why you are suitable for the program you have chosen.</p> <p>This is your opportunity to prove that you are a worthy candidate and to tell the admissions committee about your interests, achievements, experience and aspirations.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to start writing a personal statement?</strong></p> <p>Your personal statement should attract the attention of the reader from the very beginning, so it is important that the essay is focused from the beginning. Begin the essay with a short sentence that describes who you are and your motivation for studying the course you are applying for.</p> <p>Don't waste time trying to impress the admissions committee with cute aphorisms in your essay or someone's witty sayings; they know why you are doing these things. By simply conveying your enthusiasm and inner motivation from the beginning of your essay, you are more likely to make a memorable first impression.</p> <p>Writing your statement with someone else's quotes is a risky move. The person reading the essay is not interested in someone else's thoughts or words; they'd rather know about you. If you rely too much on other people's words, your statement can lose its validity.</p> <p>Don't think that you can write this essay in a day or a few days, generally in a short time. Of course, give yourself more time. Always remember that this essay is one of the most important documents for admission to your chosen course and university.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What should your personal statement include?</strong></p> <p><strong>Why do you want to study abroad:</strong> Studying abroad is a big decision, so you need to prove that you are ready for it.<br/><strong>Why study in this particular country? you want to:</strong> Tell the admissions committee why their country is the best place to fulfill your dreams.<br/><strong>Why you want to study this course: </strong>intrinsic motivation is a key component of successful personal statements. If you can show a genuine interest and love for the subject you choose to study, you will be more likely to be offered a scholarship.<br/><strong>Your future goals: </strong>Be sure to include what you want to achieve after graduation. Doing so will demonstrate your commitment and intentions to your field.<br/><strong>Language Skills:</strong> Be sure to demonstrate in your statement that you have sufficient knowledge of the language required for your chosen field.<br/><strong>Relevant Work Experience:</strong> Adding information to your essay about any volunteer work or internships in the same field as your studies will help you stand out. <br/><strong>Favorite activities and interests:</strong> In addition to studying and scientific activities, remember the activities that interest you. Connecting your extracurricular interests to the course you are applying for will take your personal statement to the next level.</p> <p><br/><strong>How many words should your personal statement be?</strong></p> <p>The required length and length of your personal statement may vary depending on your chosen field of study and whether you are applying for an undergraduate or graduate program.</p> <p>For example, if you want to study in the USA - the world's most popular country for international students - you will need to adapt the length of your essay to the word limit of each institution.</p> <p>If you choose to study in the UK, your personal statement will have a standardized length: a maximum of 4000 characters and 47 lines. You submit your personal statement to universities and colleges through a centralized portal called <strong>UCAS</strong>.</p> <p>Always check your chosen university's essay word limits before you start writing. Familiarizing yourself with the requirements will help you plan and structure your statement more effectively.</p> <p><strong>What sections can a personal statement be divided into?</strong></p> <p>There is no right or wrong way to structure an essay, but it is important to create a logical framework that covers all the information the admissions committee requires. The following general and basic structure may help you prepare your essay:</p> <p><strong>1) Introduction: </strong>This section should explain why you want to study this particular program and how it aligns with your future goals.</p> <p><strong>2) Your academic achievements:</strong> In this section, write about your relevant academic achievements and how your previous knowledge has prepared you for this course.</p> <p><strong>3) Professional Skills and Experience:</strong> Tell the reader about work experience or volunteer opportunities relevant to the person reading the essay. Also mention how the skills you acquired prepared you for higher education.</p> <p><strong>4) Extracurricular Interests:</strong> Show that you are a well-rounded person who balances your studies with your social life. Mention hobbies and activities you enjoy in your free time and skills you can apply to your program.</p> <p><strong>5) Conclusion: </strong>Conclude your personal statement by confirming why the university should offer you a place as a student. Reiterate why you are an ideal candidate and what you plan to accomplish during your time at university.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p> <p><strong>Be your true self in the essay:</strong> Admissions officers want to get to know the person behind the paper. Don't pretend to be someone you don't exist or exaggerate any of your accomplishments. <br/><strong>Avoid Grammatical and Spelling Mistakes:</strong> Poor spelling, grammar and structure can ruin a personal statement. After you finish your essay, proofread it again and again.<br><strong>Have others proofread your essay:</strong> After proofreading yourself, get your friends, family, and teachers to proofread your essay as well. They can point out things you might not have noticed before and offer helpful feedback.<br/><strong>Don't rush:</strong> The best ideas take time to develop, so it's wise to start your statement's deadline well in advance. This will give you enough time to prepare a few drafts before the due date.<br/><strong>Avoid Plagiarism: </strong>It's fine to look at examples of personal statements online, but don't try to copy or buy them. Your statement will go through an online plagiarism check and any similarities will be flagged.<br/><strong>Find out what your university is looking for:</strong> University websites and course descriptions will tell you what candidates they are looking for. Tailor your statement to these skills and characteristics.</br> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/mahalla-yettiligi-va-ularning-asosiy-vazifalari" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is from official sources..
