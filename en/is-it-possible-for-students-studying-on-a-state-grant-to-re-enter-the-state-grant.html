                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>According to it: the second and subsequent higher education is carried out on the basis of a fee-contract, and a student admitted to the relevant stage of higher education on the basis of a state grant will not be allocated a state grant for this stage of education for the second time. The provision on the second and subsequent higher education in this paragraph of the Decree is new no, this was also in the Law "On Education".</strong><br/><strong>That is, now a student admitted to the relevant stage of higher education on the basis of a state grant will not be allocated a state grant for this stage of education for the second time.</strong><br/><strong>If a student studies on a state grant for 2 years, then changes his mind, re-transfers to another course and the student is admitted again on the basis of a grant if it is done, he will not be granted a grant for 2 years, he will be forced to study under a contract.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>In the personal cabinet of some applicants, the following note appeared:</p> <p>Because you were recommended for studentship on the basis of a state grant in previous years, you cannot participate in the competition for a state grant this year. I would like to comment on this. Based on the decree of the President on May 25, a new procedure was established. According to it:</p> <p>the second and subsequent higher education is carried out on the basis of a fee-contract, and a student admitted to the relevant stage of higher education on the basis of a state grant will not receive a state grant for this stage of education for the second time. That is, the second specialty is always on the basis of a fee-contract, and no state grant is allocated to it. That is, now a student admitted to the relevant stage of higher education on the basis of a state grant will not be allocated a state grant for this stage of education a second time. A grant is not allocated only for the stage at which the student studied under the grant. For example, a student who received a grant for the 1st stage, if he resubmits again next year, he will definitely study under a contract at the 1st stage, but if his mastery is high, he can transfer to a state grant from the 2nd stage. will not be allocated, he will have to study in the contract. But in the 3rd and 4th year, he can transfer to the state grant.</p> <p> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/kirish-imtihoniga-pasport-nusxasi-bilan-borsa-boladimi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
