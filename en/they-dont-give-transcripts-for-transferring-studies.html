                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Transcript is one of the main documents One of the most important documents when transferring studies is the transcript.</strong><br/><strong>In the first case, the university should improve the quality of education in order to maintain its reputation.</strong><br/><strong>This is not only in your interest, but in the interest of thousands of students.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Transcript problem when transferring studies: Why are students struggling?</h2> <h3>"Perevod" season has begun</h3> <p>Now the season of "perevod" - i.e. transferring studies to another higher education institution - has begun in the higher education system. Every year, thousands of students, especially young people studying abroad or in private universities, try to transfer their studies to state universities.</p> <h3>Transcript is one of the main documents</h3> <p>One of the most important documents when transferring studies is <strong>transcript</strong>. Through it, information such as the student's grades, list of subjects, studied semesters is determined. The online application submitted to DTM is also based on this document.</p> <h3>Problem: There are HEIs that do not provide transcripts</h3> <p>These days, some private universities are accused of not providing transcripts to their students, or of setting various conditions in return for providing them. This situation is causing hundreds of students to wander. Although the right to transfer education is defined in the law, artificial obstacles are created in practice.</p> <p>🔗 Write about the problem in the comments - efforts are being made to summarize the problems and convey them to the relevant organizations.</p> <h3>Why do students want to transfer?</h3> <p>First of all, the university management should ask itself this question: <strong>why do students leave this school? want to leave?</strong></p> <p>In most cases, there are 2 reasons for this:</p> <h4>1. The quality of education is very low</h4> <p>The student does not find it meaningful to stay in that institution. The lessons are of poor quality, there are no qualified teachers, they are taught only for diplomas, not knowledge.</p> <h4>2. Excessive demands</h4> <p>Demands are very high in the university: internal exams are difficult, it is difficult to get grades, acquaintances do not pass. Those who cannot cope with this situation will want to move to another place.</p> <p>In the first case, the university should improve the quality of education in order to maintain its reputation. In the second case, if the student wants to transfer due to strong requirements, the university itself is probably ready to give up.</p> <h3>A call to action</h3> <p>If you are also having problems with getting a transcript, do not be indifferent. Write about it in the comments or relevant sources. This is not only in your interest, but in the interest of thousands of students.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The transfer of studies is the right of every student, but this process should be legal, fair and transparent. HEIs should not blame students instead of solving their internal problems. The student is leaving - so there is a reason for this. It is important to identify it, not to deny it. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/magistraturaga-hujjat-topshirganlar-11-mingdan-oshdi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
