                The latest news in education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>I went to the tax office to get 12% of my contract back, and they told me that in order to get 12% back, my parents or I must have worked for the government. 12 percent of the monthly salary is deducted.</strong><br/><strong> ✅ So, the conclusion is that in order to get back 12 percent of the paid contract, you or your parents or spouse must be working in an official job and 12 percent of income tax has been deducted from the monthly salary, the youth support channel writes.</strong><br/><hr/> <blockquote> <p>12 percent of the contract I went to the tax office to get a 12% refund, and they told me that in order to get a 12% refund, either my parents or I had to work for the government. Can I not get back 12% of the contract I paid without working anywhere?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Currently, the income tax in Uzbekistan is 12%. That is, 12% is withheld from the salary received by every government employee or official working in the private sector. As you can see in the picture, if an employee earns 4 million monthly, he will only receive 88% of this salary, and 12% will be withheld to the state treasury as income tax.</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/4/1100__GF4c2pn1pdhYkRQmKNsGcedFuJmXaPQP.png"/></p> <p>Almost all government workers pay income tax, but not all private sector workers pay income tax, that is, they do not work in the state, they can work on the basis of a contract or a verbal agreement. <strong>income tax is not withheld from such employees and their full salary is paid</strong>, and they are not credited with seniority. Such employees are not given credit, they cannot get back <strong>12 percent income tax for paying contracts of themselves, their spouse or children because they do not pay income tax.</strong></p> <p> ✅ <strong>So the bottom line is</strong> to get back 12 percent of the contract paid, you or your parent or spouse must be working in an official job and <strong>12 percent of monthly income tax should be withheld, </strong> writes the youth support channel.</p> <p>Payment for tax deduction is made from the following:</p> <ul> <li>own funds;</li> <li>educational loans given to individuals by commercial banks;</li> <li>subject to repayment by legal entities to individuals. </li> </ul> <p><strong>When the payment is made independently, not from the salary, a tax deduction can be used by submitting an annual income declaration.</strong></p> <p>To confirm the right to a tax deduction, the following must be submitted:</p> <ul> <li>a copy of the contract for training on a paid-contract basis;</li> <li>a contract with the bank for obtaining an educational loan (agreements) copy;</li> <li>A copy of the documents confirming the independent payment of money to the OTM account;</li> <li>A copy of the passport and a copy of the student's birth certificate.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Legal basis</strong>: lex.uz/docs/-4674902 — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/xorijiy-davlatlardan-oqishni-kochirayotganlar-diqqatiga" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>How do you feel about this news?
