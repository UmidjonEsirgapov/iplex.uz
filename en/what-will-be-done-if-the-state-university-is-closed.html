                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Two different legal standards apply to the closure of a non-state university and a state university.</strong><br/><strong>State universities themselves are rarely closed, but there are cases when they were closed despite this.</strong><br/><strong>For example, several years ago. Angren State Pedagogical University was closed, so what do you think the state did to the students?</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Two different legal standards apply when closing a non-state university and a state university. State universities are rarely closed, but there are cases where they are closed.</p> <p>For example, several years ago <strong>Angren State Pedagogical University was closed,</strong> what do you think the state did to the students? created conditions for students to graduate from the fourth year, but did not accept applicants for the first year. That is, it took four years for one state university to be closed, and then it was closed. In non-state universities, the procedure is different, after the court decision, enforcement proceedings begin immediately, and students are dispersed to other non-state universities. He cannot go to the state one, if he wants to go to the state one, he will pass the general exam.</p> <p><strong>Is it bad? </strong></p> <p>Of course it is bad, whether a student studies in a public university or a private one, he is still a citizen of this country, jobs are created with the money he pays, billions of taxes are paid to the state budget from them, so the rights of students should be put in place. he spent his life and time to study by relying on his license, now <strong>if the state revokes the license of the university,</strong> I think it should also put the student's rights in place.</p> <p>If the course he is studying will not be available in another non-state, the state should provide a solution to this, he should be admitted to the same course of the state university without any exam, because this is student's right, if you want it in a voluntary-compulsory way, it can be called a big street, but in this case, we have to put together the statements about huge reforms being carried out in our country. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/toshkentgi-test-otkaziluvchi-binolar-vaqtinchalik-kasalxonalarga-aylantirildi-test-kunlari-yana-suriladimi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p>
