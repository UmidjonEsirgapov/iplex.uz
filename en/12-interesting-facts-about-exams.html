                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The first exams appeared in ancient Babylon in the middle of the 3rd millennium BC in schools where scribes were trained. Fact 2.</strong><br/><strong>Educational institution that adopted this form of testing knowledge as an exam was E. Gluck School, founded in 1705 in Moscow. </strong><br/><strong>Entrance exams appeared again only in 1931.</strong><br/><hr/> <div class="aentry-post__text aentry-post__text--view"><strong>Fact 1.</strong> The first exams appeared in ancient Babylon in the middle of the 3rd millennium BC in schools where scribes were being trained.<br/><br/><strong>Fact 2.</strong> The word "examination" is derived from the Latin word "examen", which first means <em>tongue, arrow next to the scale,</em> and then <em>evaluation, test</em>.</div> <div class="aentry-post__text aentry-post__text--view"> </div> <div class="aentry-post__text aentry-post__text--view"><strong>Fact 3. </strong>The first mattress appeared in China in 1100.</div> <div class="aentry-post__text aentry-post__text--view"><br/><strong>Fact 4.</strong> In Europe, exams similar to the modern exams appeared in medieval universities to obtain bachelor's and master's degrees. The results of these exams are amazing: For example, at the beginning of the 16th century at the University of Leipzig, 30 out of 100 people passed the intermediate exam, and only 6 people managed to reach the final exam. As you can see, 94% of students dropped out during the entire study period.<br/><br/><strong>Fact 5.</strong> Exams first appeared in the Russian Empire during the time of Peter the Great. The school of E. Gluk, founded in Moscow in 1705, was the educational institution that adopted this form of knowledge testing as an exam. In 1837, he adopted the familiar 5-point system of examination tickets and student knowledge assessment.<br/><br/><strong>Fact 6. Many people know that Lev Tolstoy did not have a higher education, but few know why. The fact is that young Leo was afraid of a difficult exam. He studied at the Faculty of Law, although he was not an exemplary student, and in the spring of 1849 he began to take the exam for the candidate of legal sciences (certified lawyer) in St. Petersburg. He successfully passed two exams, but decided not to pass the third one and left for his village. It must be admitted that the lack of a diploma did not affect the future fate of the great writer.<br/><br><strong>Fact 7.</strong> In the Russian Empire, starting from 1872, final exams in gymnasiums were paid. One and a half months before the exams, I had to pay 10 rubles to the gymnasium fund. At the same time, not only the students of the last grade of the gymnasium, but also the students of the last grade (subject to impeccable academic performance), and even outsiders who studied in other gymnasiums could take the exam.<br><br><strong>Fact 8.</strong> After 1917, entrance exams to universities and school exams were canceled in the USSR. Entrance exams reappeared only in 1931. However, in the first years of the World War, universities accepted applicants without almost any entrance exams.</br></br></br></strong></div> <div class="aentry-post__text aentry-post__text--view"><br/><strong>Fact 9.</strong> 8 Vietnamese youths who repeated a situation similar to the famous exam scene in the movie "The Adventures of Shurik" were sentenced to 1.5 to 3 years in prison. They cheated in university exams using modern means of communication. The incident began in the summer of 2006 during the entrance exams for the Hanoi Banking Academy. During the exam, one long-haired applicant attracted the attention of the control commission, who answered the questions correctly, but very vaguely. It turned out that the Vietnamese were wearing wigs with earplugs hidden. In addition, a mobile phone connected to it was found in a hidden pocket of a cunningly sewn shirt. The police intervened and quickly tracked down a "gang of clowns" who were receiving from 20 million to 50 million dong ($1,200 to $3,000 at the exchange rate at the time) for "services".</div> <div class="aentry-post__text aentry-post__text--view"> </div> <div class="aentry-post__text aentry-post__text--view"><img alt="14 sovetov kak sdat эксман • Slutsk • Gazeta «Ínfa-Kur’er»" src="https://kurjer.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/17/examinations/160517_exam.jpg"/></div> <div class="aentry-post__text aentry-post__text--view"><br/><strong>Fact 10.</strong> In March 2015, in the school exams in the state of Bihar, India after a high-profile public fraud scandal, nearly 300 people were arrested.
