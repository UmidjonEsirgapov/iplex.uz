                Important news for students and applicants has been announced.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Today's conversation will be about studying in Germany, and our hero will be a DAAD HSK program (summer language course) participant, a Copernicus (IES Program - exchange program for requirements) grant winner, and most importantly, a DAAD grant holder (fully funded grant for master's studies). Umrbek Ibragimov will share his experiences with us.</strong><br/><strong>But it will be possible without him.</strong><br/><strong>(You can find information about the requirements and necessary documents for applying for the DAAD grant program below).</strong><br/><hr/> <p><em>Today's conversation will be devoted to the topic of <strong>Study in Germany</strong>, and our hero is the <strong>DAAD HSK program. </strong>(summer language course)<strong> participant, Copernicus </strong></em>(IES Program - exchange program for requirements) <em><strong>grant winner, </strong></em>principal,<em><strong> DAAD grant </strong></em>(fully funded grant for master's studies)<em><strong> owner Umrbek Ibragimov </strong></em>will share his experiences with us.</p> <ol> <li> It will be true even if we apply it not only to the residents of our village, but to the entire people of Khorezm. After all, our great poet Matnazar Abdulhakim also said, "There are no mountains in Khorezm, but there are people like a blue mountain." I got it in my village and in the city of Urganch. Due to my interest in history, in 2017 I applied to the Faculty of History of Urganch State University and was accepted to study on the basis of a state grant. During my time at the university, I had the opportunity to study the <strong>German language</strong> more deeply, which I had learned independently as a child. I did not limit myself to language learning in my studies, I also did various researches in my field and with the help of my teachers, I started to publish my scientific articles one after another. Sometimes when I was working on my scientific articles, due to the lack of resources in Uzbek, I began to get the information I needed from <em>German books</em>. After that, it became clear to me that <em>there are many sources of Uzbek history in Germany that are not yet known to us.</em> However, even though I knew the German language at that time, I did not know that it was possible to go to Germany to do research and that there were educational grants. When I first heard about the grants from German professor Hans Passman, who worked at our University, I started to prepare my documents for the grant based on his recommendations, and for the first time in 2019, I won a 1-month grant to do a summer language course under the DAAD HSK program in Germany.  My hopes were dashed. But by God's grace, despite the quarantine, I was also awarded the Copernicus grant in 2021, and I started studying at the Free University of Berlin (Freie Universität Berlin) from April this year. In the meantime, I have been accepted to the master's degree grant program announced by the DAAD organization, and I will start my studies at the Free University of Berlin in October 2021. <li><em><strong>How to go to Germany and what are the requirements and benefits of that famous DAAD scholarship?</strong></em></li> </li></ol> <p>Germany is a country of opportunities! Ways of Uzbeks coming here are: coming to study (bachelor, master...), Au-Pair (babysitting), Ausbildung and Dulaes Studium (vocational study), FSJ and BFD (volunteer programs), Praktika. Ease In Germany, if a student has a language certificate, the chances of being accepted are very high. Because in Germany it is difficult to graduate, not to enter. The difficulty is that each student must deposit 10,332 euros in a closed bank account before coming to Germany. This money is intended to cover the student's tuition and living expenses for one year. But not everyone can show such a large amount of money, and in such a situation grants from the DAAD organization come to the rescue. This grant program <strong>covers the student's expenses for the entire period of study and additional airfares</strong>. This is a great opportunity for students, which can ensure that they can study safely and focus on their studies. But winning this grant has its own difficulties, and the student is required to speak German or English well, to have thorough knowledge in his field, and especially to have a clear goal in front of him.</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/1/1100__Jsnesl5FBkgKqhc-3desh2jPZNMWHywQ.png"/></p> <ol start="3"> <li><strong>What do you think is the most important factor when applying for DAAD? Motivation letter/grade/IELTS or German language proficiency level?</strong></li> </ol> <p>As I said above, I believe that having a clear goal and good knowledge in your field is one of the most important requirements when applying for DAAD. And besides, he should be able to present this knowledge and plans in a short and concise manner in his motivational letter. <strong>Motivation letter</strong> plays an important role in winning a grant from DAAD. Things like <em>Grades and language certificate</em> don't play a very important role. Language certificate and grades can play a role in cases where there are only two candidates with the same potential. For example, when I applied for DAAD, I did not have the language certificate required by the program. I later submitted it to DAAD.</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/1/1100__MP7cN_k0COZiMjKyYvY55DAdu0mzE5-V.png"/></p> <ol start="4"> <li><em><strong>Is it possible to submit 4th year requirements for DAAD who have not yet completed their studies? How important is work experience?</strong></em></li> </ol> <p>Students who have not completed the 4th year can also apply to DAAD. There is no limit to them. Having work experience can definitely play a big role in getting a grant. But it will be without him. For example, <strong>I didn't work anywhere when I applied.</strong></p> <p> </p> <ol start="5"> <li><em><strong>What should you pay attention to when applying for DAAD, how long before the application deadline can you start?</strong></em></li> </ol> <p>When applying for DAAD, first of all, the requirements of the program you are applying for, what documents are required, and what else is the winner of this program. it is necessary to pay attention to the advice of those who have been there. (<em><strong>You can find information about the requirements and necessary documents for applying for the DAAD grant program below</strong></em>). I would recommend to start preparing <strong>2 months</strong> before applying. The first thing to do is to <em>start with clarifying your future goals</em>. Then a university and a field of study that correspond to these goals are found. After these two main things are clear, writing a motivational letter begins. When I wrote my cover letter, I jotted down the best sentences that came to my mind in my notebook and put them into a single cover letter form close to my application date. In this interval, documents such as curriculum vitae, grade book and school (college) grades are signed. But I would not recommend leaving the application until the last day. Because many documents are sent from all over the world on this day, there will be interruptions on the site.</p> <p><img src="https://static.oliygoh.uz/uploads/1/1100___cKQApmeVj6_F8q_N18c_S139ltbwtgG.png"/></p> <ol start="6"> <li><strong>Your advice to young people studying in Germany</strong></li> </ol> <p>The first thing I would say to young people who want to study in Germany is <strong>don't be afraid</strong>! Many of our educated young people, even if they have knowledge, stay without submitting documents saying "I can't pass, it is necessary to prepare for it with older people". But there is no such thing as impossible in this world. If someone can first get the necessary knowledge about the program and carefully explain his goals and knowledge to the Germans, he will definitely pass. It does not require the help of any additional people (or consulting firms). If it wasn't for this, I, a young man from a remote village of Khorezm, would not have won this grant!</p> <p><em><strong>We, the organizers of oliygoh.uz, would like to say a big thank you to our today's hero Umrbek Ibragimov for the wonderful conversation and the necessary information. We wish Umrbek Ibragimov great success in his future studies and work. Let there be more successful people like you who can be an example for Uzbek youth!</strong></em> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/davlat-oliygohlari-xususiylashtiriladi" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
