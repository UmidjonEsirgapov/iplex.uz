                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Usually, applicants are required to pay several times the normal contract fee to enter studies on the basis of a "super-contract". accepted in the same way as higher education institutions.</strong><br/><strong>Conclusion The abolition of the preferential 50 percent "super-contract" procedure in agricultural HEIs has created new financial and academic requirements for applicants.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>The preferential "super-contract" in agricultural HEIs has been canceled</h2> <p>By the government's decision The 50 percent preferential "super-contract" procedure for admission to higher education institutions under the system of the Ministry of Agriculture has been canceled. This change was made on the basis of the amendments made to the regulation defining the procedure for admission to bachelor's degrees of higher education organizations.</p> <h2>What changes were made based on the new decision?</h2> <p>Amendment was made to the regulation approved by the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 578 dated September 13, 2025. According to it, the norm that is present in paragraph 74 of the regulation and gives preferential treatment to higher educational institutions in the field of agriculture has been removed. Generally, applicants are required to pay several times the regular contract fee to study under the "super-contract".</p> <p>However, there is a special privilege for applicants who choose the agricultural field, they have the opportunity to become a student by paying 50% of the differentiated contract fee.</p> <h3>What will be the procedure for applicants now?</h3> <p>According to the new decision, the applicants who failed to collect the entrance score to the higher education institutions in the field of agriculture will be accepted in the same way as other higher education institutions. That is, they will have to pay the full amount of the differentiated contract fee in order to study on the basis of a super-contract.</p> <h2>Which HEIs are affected by this change?</h2> <h3>HEIs under the system of the Ministry of Agriculture</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Tashkent State Agrarian University</p> </li> <li> <p>Karakalpakstan Rural Institute of Agriculture and Agro-Technology</p> </li> <li> <p>Samarkand Institute of Agricultural Innovations and Research</p> </li> <li> <p>Andijan Institute of Agriculture and Agro-Technology</p> </li> <li> <p>International Institute of Food Technology and Engineering</p> </li> </ul> <h3>VET in the field of veterinary and animal husbandry</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Samarkand State Veterinary Medicine, Animal Husbandry and Biotechnology University</p> </li> <li> <p>Samarkand State Veterinary Medicine, Animal Husbandry and Biotechnology University Nukus Branch</p> </li> <li> <p>Samarkand State Veterinary Medicine, Animal Husbandry and Biotechnology University Tashkent Branch</p> </li> </ul> <h2>Decision to applicants impact</h2> <p>This change may increase the financial burden for applicants planning to study in the field of agriculture. For this reason, applicants are required to prepare more thoroughly for the entrance exams.</p> <p>Also, the new procedure is expected to serve to organize the admission process in higher education institutions on the basis of a single system.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Abolition of the preferential 50 percent "super-contract" procedure in agricultural higher education institutions has created new financial and academic requirements for applicants. Now all applicants participate in the admission process under the same conditions. This is an important change aimed at ensuring equality and transparency in the education system. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/davlat-otmlariga-hujjat-topshirish-20-iyunda-boshlanadi-bilishingiz-kerak-bolganlar" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education..
