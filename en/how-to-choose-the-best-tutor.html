                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>Ask about the qualifications of the teacher and look at his documents, but do not limit yourself to this and pay attention to how he behaves during the training session. ask.</strong><br/><strong>In this case, it is better to find a new tutor: there is no need to be ashamed or afraid of offending the pedagogue.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>9 simple rules for finding the best pedagogue.</p> <h3><strong>1. Set a clear goal</strong></h3> <p>First of all, determine why your child needs a tutor: to improve his grades in a subject, to explain difficult topics, to help prepare for an exam or to acquire new knowledge, for example, a second foreign language.</p> <p>A clear goal will help the pedagogue to create an effective work plan, and you to evaluate the process.</p> <h3><strong>2. Talk to the child </strong></h3> <p>Your child is the one doing the tutoring, not you. It should be convenient for him to learn from a particular teacher. Be sure to ask who the child wants to learn from: a man or a woman, a student or an older teacher, a gentle or strict tutor (educator).</p> <h3><strong>3. Evaluate the work experience and knowledge of the teacher</strong></h3> <p>The number of diplomas and certificates does not always determine the quality. A tutor may have received higher education a long time ago, and then did not work in his field, and he may conduct courses in some unclear way.</p> <p>Ask about the qualifications of the teacher and look at his documents, but do not limit yourself to these, but pay attention to how he behaves during training.</p> <h3><strong>4. Take into account the compatibility of the teacher and the age of the child</strong></h3> <p>It makes no sense for a university professor to work with a third-grader, and teenagers may not take themselves seriously in relation to student-tutors. Therefore, it is better to choose a tutor in this way:</p> <ul> <li>students and recent university graduates are suitable for junior students;</li> <li>middle class - graduates and school teachers;</li> <li>for older classes - relatively qualified pedagogues.</li> </ul> <p>But do not forget the other side: what age the child should train with a tutor. let him know what he wants. Convenience is above all else.</p> <h3><strong>5. Compare prices</strong></h3> <p>The amount of payment for training depends on several parameters:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Qualification</strong>. Usually, students do not ask for much, and it is natural that there is a difference in the price set by a tutor with 5-7 years of minor skills and a university professor or a tutor with many years of experience. </li> <li><strong>Duration of training. </strong>The lesson with a tutor can be 45 minutes (like in school), 60 minutes (astronomical clock), 90 minutes (like university coins) or even 2 hours. The longer the lesson time, the higher the price.</li> <li><strong>Intensity level.</strong> For example, if an 11th-grade student applies for a tutor at the beginning of the academic year, there is enough time for training, so the intensity is average. The intensity is significantly higher if a school graduate wants to start training only a month before the exams of higher education institutions. The price will increase accordingly.</li> <li><strong>Fan</strong>. Subjects are graded differently. Taking lessons in English and mathematics is the most expensive, for example, in the city of Tashkent, it costs an average of 500-700 thousand soums per month, in some courses up to 1.5 million soums. And native language courses are at most 200-300 thousand soums.</li> </ul> <p>Compare the prices set by tutors in your city. Do not choose the cheapest tutor (except for students and beginners). Remember: your task is not to save money, but to find a teacher who can help your child learn science. Try to find a tutor that suits both your needs and your budget. Find the middle ground.</p> <h3><strong>6. Choose where the lessons will be held</strong></h3> <p>Studies with a tutor can be held in 3 ways:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Come home.</strong> This way is the most convenient for the child. You also don't worry too much about how the training is going. But in this case tutors ask for more money. Of course, they take into account the issues of road and time.</li> <li><strong>Via video-communication</strong>. It can be approached when the quality of the Internet is able to meet this and the child is satisfied with such knowledge. At home or at work (school, high school, university or training center). This training is the best in terms of price. Look for a tutor in an area closer to home to make it easier for the child. Chances of getting lost or getting tired on a long journey are reduced.</li> </ul> <h3><strong>7. Meet the tutor in person</strong></h3> <p>Before sending the child to the lesson, meet the teacher. Only then can you fully imagine the image of a pedagogue. Pay attention to the following details:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Appearance.</strong> The tutor should be as organized as possible.</li> <li><strong>Speech</strong>. Tone, pitch, and pitch are all important. It is also necessary to pay attention to sloppy speech: neither a native language teacher nor a physics tutor has the right to confuse words. </li> <li><strong>Interior</strong>. If the tutor says he will teach at his home, visit the home before making an appointment. Make sure the room is clean and well-lit.</li> </ul> <p>During the first meeting, ask the teacher how the lesson will be conducted. Or be interested in the opinions of students and their parents who studied there. Only then will you know what results your child can achieve with the help of a tutor. You can also ask the tutor questions about the exam results of his previous students and which university they attended.</p> <p>For example, if your child wants to take classes in physics and apply for a technical specialty, it is important to know that there are graduates who have joined the ranks of the pedagogue. there will be excellent light upon light.</p> <h3><strong>8. Come to keep calling</strong></h3> <p>In order to achieve results, it is necessary to be aware of how successfully the lessons are going. Ask the teacher to tell you how the process is going: let him know what lessons the child has completed and what subject he will learn now.</p> <h3><strong>9. Don't be afraid to compare options</strong></h3> <p>Finding the perfect tutor on the first try is possible, but difficult. The tutor may not like the child or simply does not provide the result he promised.</p> <p>In this case, it is better to find a new tutor: you should not be ashamed or afraid of offending the pedagogue. Remember: the goal of the activity is to help your child learn and learn new skills. </p> <p>Tutors themselves cannot refuse training. Their task is to approach each student individually. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/abituriyentlarda-ruhiy-charchoq-va-uyqu-buzilishi" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
