                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>External education has been canceled: what is the main reason?</strong><br/><strong>Now distance education will be introduced instead. We are doing it.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>Correspondence education has been canceled: what is the main reason?</h2> <h3>The Minister of Higher Education explained the reason for the cancellation of correspondence education</h3> <p>The Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation Kongirotboy Sharipov explained the reason why correspondence education was stopped in Uzbekistan according to his words, the main reason was insufficient provision of the quality of education. Because we know that most of the students are busy with work and cannot come to class on time," said the minister.</p>  <h3>Now distance education will be introduced instead</h3> <p>The minister said that instead of correspondence education, <strong>distance education</strong> will be introduced. In this form, classes will be held under strict control. Every student <strong>participates in daily online classes</strong>, exams will be transparent. </p> <blockquote> <p>"The computer will be automatically turned off if another person attends the class instead or if a "spreadsheet" is used," the minister noted.</p> </blockquote> <h3>World experience: there is no correspondence education, there are alternative forms</h3> <p>According to Sharipov, there is no correspondence education in the world experience. Europe, the United States and other developed countries states have <strong>day, evening, distance and extended forms of education</strong>, and students can continue their studies from 4 to 10 years depending on their situation.</p> <blockquote> <p>"We are introducing programs of top-300 universities. We are inviting professors and teachers from abroad. We should not be afraid of this - an alternative, high-quality form of education is being introduced," said the minister.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The form of part-time education has been officially ended in Uzbekistan. The main reason for this is the limited ability to control the quality of education. Now a form of distance education will be introduced, and it is expected that a more modern and effective education system will be formed through this. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/homilador-xodim-ishdan-boshasa-unga-dekret-puli-tolanadimi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: oliygoh.uz prepared on the basis of information from the site.
