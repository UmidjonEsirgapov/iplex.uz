                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>In order to improve the quality of education and reform the sector based on advanced foreign experience: a) from September 1, 2023, in one general secondary educational institution of each district (city), the practice of teaching students two foreign languages and one profession should be gradually launched. If you notice, our officials love the phrase "advanced foreign experience".</strong><br/><strong>Teaching students two foreign languages.</strong><br/><strong>This includes: teaching students in the 1st-4th grades of general secondary education institutions according to textbooks developed on the basis of advanced foreign experience; providing students with basic knowledge of general education subjects in the 5th-9th grades; Introduce the practice of imparting knowledge based on the interests and abilities of the 10th-11th graders."</strong><br/><hr/> We will analyze some clauses related to the educational system of the State Program for 2023. <p>"<strong>8. In order to improve the quality of education and reform the field based on advanced foreign experience</strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>a) Starting from September 1, 2023, in one general secondary educational institution of each district (city), the practice of teaching students two foreign languages and one profession should be gradually started."</p> </blockquote> <p>If you notice, our officials like the phrase "advanced foreign experience". No matter what document you take in the field of education - state program, concept, decision, decree - you will come across this sentence. What do we mean by "advanced foreign experience"? What is our exact goal, where is our destination? To achieve this goal, <strong>how many parts of the destination have we passed and how much is left?</strong> Or is it written on the forehead of Uzbekistan's education system to be reformed on the basis of "advanced foreign experience"?</p> <p><strong>Teach two foreign languages ​​to students. If we want the student to at least not lose himself when entering the environment of this language, to be able to communicate with native speakers, to be able to meet his daily needs through this language and to find and understand the information he needs, then a student graduating from school should <strong>be at least B1 level according to CEFR</strong>. For this, according to experts, at least 530-680 study hours are needed. At a time when it has been discussed for years that the educational workload of Uzbekistan's students is higher than in other countries, where are the hours to teach one additional language?</strong></p> <p><strong>Another aspect.</strong> In addition to the mother tongue, schools also teach <strong>at least two other languages: </strong>Russian (which is also not the mother tongue for an Uzbek child) and foreign language (English, German, French or other). How effective is the addition of a third language on top of these languages?</p> <p><strong>Vocational training. </strong>Vocational training is also a <strong>systematic and time-consuming</strong> process: for the system to work effectively, it is necessary to solve many interrelated issues, such as special training programs, requirements for the qualifications of vocational trainers, communication with the future work environment, and quality control in the vocational training system. You can't teach a profession by setting aside one day a week and taking students to the workshop on that day or taking a tired student to sit in a circle. As we love the phrase "<strong>Advanced foreign experience</strong>", which "advanced foreign experience" has effectively implemented vocational training in the secondary school system? What are the recommendations of international organizations (for example, OECD) on the organization of vocational education and which of them can we apply in our school environment?  harmonizing with the classifier", "establishing a completely new professional education system based on advanced foreign experience"?</p> <p>In general, in any school, has the proposal "<strong>to introduce training for two foreign languages and one profession</strong>" been scientifically analyzed? Or is it necessary to establish one such school in each district (city) as a "<strong>model-viewing</strong> school ("obraztsovo-pokazatelnaya shkola") in the style of "Potyomkin" to be taken during the visits of the head of state? What will the educational system of Uzbekistan gain and lose from this? </p> <p>"<strong>8. In order to improve the quality of education, to reform the field based on advanced foreign experience:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>b) from the 2023/2024 academic year, gradually educate students in general secondary educational institutions in the spirit of universal and national values, patriotism, as well as communication skills, critical and creative thinking, team building educational programs aimed at forming skills such as work and research should be put into practice.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>In this:</strong></p> <ul> <li>teaching students in 1-4th grades of general secondary education institutions according to textbooks developed on the basis of advanced foreign experience;</li> <li>in 5th-9th grades students should be given basic knowledge of general education subjects </li> <li>introduce the practice of imparting knowledge on the basis of specialized programs that match the interests and abilities of 10-11th grade students."</li> </ul> <p><strong>Step by step introduction of educational programs from the 2023/2024 academic year. Stop. Let's clarify. What educational programs are we talking about? </strong></p> <p>The 2023 program is a part of the "Development Strategy of New Uzbekistan for 2022-2026" approved in 2022, as can be seen from the name of the decree ("On the state program for the implementation of the development strategy of New Uzbekistan for the years 2022-2026 in the year "Focus on people and quality education"). rather, it was adopted in order to implement this general strategy, right? In "Development Strategy of New Uzbekistan for 2022 - 2026", in order to "completely review and implement curriculum and textbooks by 2026 based on advanced foreign experience" (goal 42), "new textbooks, exercise books, teaching methodology books and mobile the task of "creating applications" is defined. In the program of 2023, <strong>does the term "educational programs" refer to the National Curriculum?</strong> If "yes", then instead of lofty and long sentences, "educational programs aimed at educating students in the spirit of universal and national values, patriotism, as well as communication skills, critical and creative thinking, teamwork, research" Can't it be called "National Curriculum"? If no, is this a new program? <strong>What will happen to the national curriculum created with the money of taxpayers and international donors?</strong> In which "advanced foreign experience" have you seen new educational programs "gradually" introduced every two to three years?</p> <p><strong>Education of students in grades 1-4 according to textbooks developed on the basis of advanced foreign experience.</strong> The same question. <strong>Which textbooks are intended?</strong> Textbooks created with the support of the state budget and UNICEF based on the national curriculum? These textbooks for grades 1-3 have been created and are currently being used in schools, while those for grade 4 were to be created this year according to the presidential decree. There are textbooks created with the funds of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), as well as textbooks created with the money of Komil Allamjonov, the deputy head of the Presidential Administration. All this, according to statements, is based on international experience. The 2023 program does not clarify any of the previously asked questions about the future fate of these textbooks.</p> <p><strong>Another important aspect.</strong> International organizations and international donors also participated in the creation of the national curriculum, textbooks based on it, and textbooks within the framework of the "Education for excellence in Uzbekistan" program. Considering that sustainability and long-term impact are important criteria in evaluating the effectiveness of international projects, how can changing programs and textbooks every two to three years affect the reputation of Uzbekistan in front of international donors and their desire to allocate funds and spend energy on projects in Uzbekistan in the future? According to the Law "On Education", "primary secondary education (grades 5-9) provides students with the necessary amount of knowledge, skills and abilities in accordance with the curriculum, develops independent thinking and analytical skills in them." Therefore, what is the purpose of including this item in the program of 2023, what meaning (smyslovaya nagruzka) does it carry? If education on the basis of specialized programs is introduced in all schools in grades 10-11, what is the role of specialized schools and boarding schools in the system of the Presidential Educational Institutions Agency (now the Agency of Specialized Educational Institutions) that accept students from grades 5 and 7? How does the "teaching on the basis of specialized programs" provided for in the 2023 program differ from the variant curricula introduced by the Ministry of Public Education in 2020 in order to "create conditions for students to study the subjects they are interested in"?</p> <p><strong>In general, those who participated in the process of writing, processing, agreeing and approving the draft of the 2023 state program based on the proposals made during the discussion are in the educational system. Are you aware of the processes that have been carried out up until now, have you analyzed their results?</strong> Or is the educational system doomed to start from "zero" every time the leaders change? Is it written on the forehead of the education system of Uzbekistan to be reformed on the basis of "Advanced foreign experience"?  <p><strong>In this, it should be ensured that the types of food are delivered according to the age and health status of the students and meet the sanitary requirements."</strong></p> <p>Here, <strong>in my opinion, there is no need for an explanation</strong>. As soon as the so-called "free" (not really free - the taxpayer pays for it) food initiative was announced, experts expressed their concerns. When we say "on the basis of advanced foreign experience", in which "advanced foreign experience" does an organization engaged in construction deliver 4,700 soums of food to a child? What kind of food can he provide for 4,700 soums "according to the age and health status of the students" that will not harm his health? Have those who included this item in the program, for example, familiarized themselves with the recommendations of the World Health Organization on the organization of meals in schools? To what extent does the mechanism implemented in Karakalpakstan and Khorezm and now applied to the whole republic correspond to these recommendations or other advanced foreign experience? — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qaysi-platformadan-qayerga-hujjat-topshiriladi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p></p>
