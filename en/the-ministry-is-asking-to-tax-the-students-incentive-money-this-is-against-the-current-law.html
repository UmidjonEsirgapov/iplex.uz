                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The letter of the Tax Committee does not contain any sentence about the deduction of tax from the incentive money of students.</strong><br/><strong>According to information in Kun.uz, forcing some university rectors to pay income tax on the incentive money paid so far started.</strong><br/><strong>But we are working on it now.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation</strong> sent a letter to the rectors asking to deduct income tax from <strong>incentive money</strong> given to students. But a few months ago, the Tax Committee stated that this was wrong.</p> <p>A letter sent to the rectors of higher education institutions on June 19, 2024, signed by the Deputy Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, Sarvar Buzrukkhanov, was circulated on social networks. It states that <strong>income tax should be collected</strong> from the awards and incentive funds paid to students. The ministry asked the rectors to transfer the income tax funds to the budget and submit the information about the payment by 11:00 on June 21. The letter is based on the letter of the Tax Committee dated June 6, 2024. According to the committee's letter, the Accounts Chamber found deficiencies in the tax legislation in <strong>OTFIV</strong> and ministerial organizations in its studies and sent a letter about it to the Tax Committee on May 21. On this basis, the Committee requested organizations in the OTFIV system to submit clarified tax reports or justifications for identified discrepancies. It was also noted that if the shortcomings are not eliminated, a tax audit will be conducted in accordance with the established procedure.</p> <p><strong>The letter of the Tax Committee does not contain any sentence about the deduction of tax from the students' incentive money.</strong> Well, according to which legislation are the incentive money being taxed?</p> <p>According to the information in Kun.uz, the incentives paid to some university rectors forced to pay income tax on their money. However, there is no such norm in the current tax legislation.</p> <p>Here is an addition: in January 2024, there were reports that income tax was being deducted from the incentive money received by the students of Nizamiy Tashkent State Pedagogical University. After that, the head of the Tax Committee, Shukhrat Ismailov, informed that the money paid to encourage students is not subject to personal income tax. He said that Article 369 of the Tax Code defines the incomes of individuals that are not included in the total income of individuals. It states that monetary awards paid to individuals in one lump sum based on the decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers are not included in the total income of individuals and are exempted from personal income tax.</p> <p>"According to this, this higher education institution should not deduct personal income tax as a tax agent from the fees paid for student incentives. We contacted the institution and gave relevant explanations about it," said the official.</p> <p>On June 21, at the meeting of the youth and the minister, one of the students asked the minister Kungirotboy Sharipov for an explanation on the same problem. Sharipov said that he was aware of the situation and explained why a letter was sent to the EOs.</p> <p>"This came out after a recent investigation. But we are working on it now. In fact, if you knew about it, we would not have given it. Because our goal is not to create problems for you. The laws are changing now. That's why there are misunderstandings," the minister said.</p> <p>The head of the finance, economy and infrastructure development department of the ministry, Maqsud Hamroyev, informed that the letter about receiving <strong>income tax from financial incentives</strong> given to students has no effect on scholarships or other payments, and the issue of higher education institutions continuing to give incentive money and collecting income tax from them is urgent. He noted that it will be resolved in the meantime. No student will be charged. It will create a payment system and launch it soon. But even now, incentives for students of higher education institutions have not been stopped. There are no objections. Only the issue of tax collection is under consideration. We would like to propose this, and we are also considering the issues of maintaining it in the previous state," said the official.</p> <p>source — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/germaniya-marshall-fondi-parijdagi-ofisida-tolanadigan-stajirovka-elon-qiladi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>What do you think of this news?
