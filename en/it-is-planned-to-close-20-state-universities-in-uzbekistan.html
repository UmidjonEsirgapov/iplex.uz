                Today, the most relevant news in the field of education was:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>The minister said that there are a number of state HEIs in the republic that do not meet the teaching standards. </strong><br/><hr/> <h3><strong>20 state universities will be closed in Uzbekistan</strong></h3> <p>Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation Kungirotboy Sharipov announced in the YouTube podcast "Lolazor".</p> <p>The minister said that there are a number of state HEIs in the republic that do not meet teaching standards. At the moment, it is planned to register and close them. President Shavkat Mirziyoyev ordered the closure of 20 non-compliant state-owned universities. Their list will be formed soon.</p> <blockquote> <p>"Which universities have a low rate of employment of their graduates will be closed. This is a process related to regional branches. Universities are opened in remote districts. They have no staff, the potential is very low. There are no professors there. Most of the students enter those universities to 'transfer' their studies to another OTM. Because "The entrance score is low in the branches. I don't want to study there, I want to move here," said Sharipov. Because there is no demand for university graduates.</p> <blockquote> <p>"So much is being spent on buildings and teachers. Especially if we train personnel in the technical field, students pay 6-7 million soums as contract money. But each of them costs the state 20 million soums. Now there are 67 private and 111 state higher education institutions in Uzbekistan. The reason for the closure of some universities is the number of public and private HEIs will be equal," he said.</p> </blockquote> <p>Earlier we reported on the opening of 2 new universities in Termiz and Tashkent — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/talabalar-kontrakti-uchun-qilingan-tolovlardan-12-qaytarib-olish-toliq-qollanma" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>For more information, visit the oliygoh.uz site.</blockquote>
