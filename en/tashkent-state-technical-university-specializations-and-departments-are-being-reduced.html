                The most relevant news in the field of education today is:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>This process is aimed at making the educational programs of the university more effective and providing students with the opportunity to study in modern and relevant fields. provides an opportunity to receive education in accordance with the standards and strengthens the recognition of Uzbekistan's education system on a global scale.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>Tashkent State Technical University (TDTU) is undergoing comprehensive reforms. These changes are adopted in order to update the educational system of the university and adapt it to the requirements of the labor market. Below, we provide detailed information about the main aspects of the reforms and the expected results.</p> <h3>1. Specializations that are not in demand in the labor market will be reduced</h3> <p>Specializations that are not in demand in the labor market will be reduced at the university. This process is aimed at making the educational programs of the university more effective and providing opportunities for students to study in modern and relevant fields. At the same time, some departments will be combined, which will help to further optimize educational resources.</p> <h3>2. Transition to Dual Education System</h3> <p>TDTU will transition to a full dual education system. This system allows students to combine theoretical knowledge with practice, thereby gaining real-life work experience. This change is aimed at increasing the efficiency of education and preparing students for the labor market.</p> <h3>3. Reducing the Number of Subjects</h3> <p>The subjects taught at the university will be reduced by at least 30 percent. This reduces the educational load for students and allows them to focus more on basic and important subjects. At the same time, it aims to adapt educational programs to modern requirements and needs of the labor market.</p> <h3>4. Reducing the workload of professors-teachers</h3> <p>The educational workload of professors-teachers will be reduced as part of the reforms. Currently, the teaching load of teachers is reduced to 400-450 hours. This allows teachers to better organize the educational process and pay more attention to students.</p> <h3>5. Digital Dean's Office Services</h3> <p>Dean's Office services are fully digitized at the university. A "Registrar's Office" will be organized in accordance with the best practices abroad, and this will help to make educational processes more efficient and convenient. In this process, the positions of 11 deans and deputy deans will be reduced, which will optimize the management system.</p> <h3>6. Adaptation to International Programs</h3> <p>Education at TDTU is adapted to the programs of the Technical University of Dresden (Germany) and the University of Tsukuba (Japan). This gives students the opportunity to receive education in accordance with international standards and strengthens the recognition of Uzbekistan's education system at the global level. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/jamoat-xavfsizligi-universitetiga-hujjatlar-qabul-qilinmoqda" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p>
