                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>As we reported earlier, the results of the test on August 13 have also been announced.</strong><br/><strong>So, those who are currently within the quota allocated according to the list will definitely be students.</strong><br/><strong>But they cannot know for sure now.</strong><br/><hr/> <p>As we previously reported, the results of the test on August 13 have also been announced. So, this means that the results of all the tests that took place from August 1 to August 13 have been announced.</p> <p>So what does this mean? So, the list on the mandat.uzbmb.uz website will not change any more.</p> <p>By the way, those who are currently on the list of those who entered the main quota can celebrate their graduation without waiting for the final results (poor rams😃). (that is, 1 person is on 5 lists), and in the mandate, only 1 person remains on the list and is deleted from all four. This means that someone will leave the current list, but foreigners with high marks from other fields will not be added to the list.</p> <p>In addition, those who received a military recommendation, people with disabilities, women with a recommendation, children of military personnel and those with other privileges will leave the general list according to an additional quota. your probability is very high, but it is clear that you will not go down.</p> <p>So, those who are currently in the quota allocated according to the list will definitely be students. Also, those who are currently at the beginning of the contract can increase the budget.</p> <p>What about those who could not enter? Can they hope?</p> <p>Yes, they can. <strong>But they can't know for sure right now. They should wait patiently and pray.</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/talaba-bolmoqchimisiz-unda-albatta-oqing" rel="dofollow">Read on infoedu.uz</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources.
