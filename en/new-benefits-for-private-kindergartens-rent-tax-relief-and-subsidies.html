                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>New opportunities for non-state educational organizations Non-state educational organizations providing pre-school and general secondary education services are planned to be allowed to organize one-year school preparation groups.</strong><br/><strong>State support for private kindergartens will be strengthened Level of coverage in the field of pre-school education New support mechanisms for entrepreneurs will be introduced in areas with less than 80% coverage (except Tashkent city).</strong><br/><strong>Preferential loans for non-state kindergartens In regions with a low level of coverage, up to 5 billion soums of preferential loans will be allocated to entrepreneurs who have established non-state kindergartens with at least 150 places in low-coverage areas.</strong><br/><hr/> <h2>New for non-state kindergartens benefits: important changes in the preschool education system</h2> <p>On February 4, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev got acquainted with the presentation of proposals aimed at further improving the preschool education and upbringing system. During the presentation, special attention was paid to the issues of wide involvement of the private sector in the field, support of entrepreneurs and quality preparation of children for school.</p> <h2>New opportunities for non-governmental educational organizations</h2> <p>It is planned to allow non-governmental educational organizations that provide preschool and general secondary education services to organize one-year school preparation groups. It is expected that the level of children's preparation for school will increase and the quality of education will improve.</p> <h3>Electronic certificate will be introduced</h3> <p>From the 2027-2028 school year, it is planned to issue a state model electronic certificate to children who have received education in school preparation groups. This information will later be included in the certificate of general secondary education.</p> <h2>State support for private kindergartens will be strengthened</h2> <p>New support mechanisms will be introduced for entrepreneurs in regions with a coverage rate of preschool education below 80% (except for the city of Tashkent).</p> <h3>Rent payments up to 30 years not charged</h3> <p>When non-state kindergartens are established on free land in the area of schools and kindergartens on the basis of public-private partnership, it is established that rent payments will not be charged for up to 30 years. This serves to reduce the costs of entrepreneurs.</p> <h3>Subsidies will be allocated</h3> <p>For each pupil, a subsidy will be allocated in the amount of 50% of the cost of one child in the state kindergarten. This procedure will also be applied to non-state kindergartens established in 2024.</p> <h2>Preferential loans for non-state kindergartens</h2> <p>Entrepreneurs who have established non-state kindergartens with at least 150 places in areas with a low level of coverage will receive preferential loans of up to 5 billion soums for a period of up to 7 years.</p> <h3>Teachers' salaries will be covered by the state</h3> <p>In order to create additional convenience for business entities, the salary of educators will be reimbursed for three years based on the standards established in state kindergartens. It is planned to allocate one teacher for every 30 children.</p> <h2>Private kindergartens can also be opened in apartment buildings</h2> <p>These benefits are also applied to private kindergartens established on the first floor of new apartment buildings. This will serve to expand preschool education services in convenient areas for the population.</p> <h3>Reliefs on social tax</h3> <p>Until January 1, 2030, it is decided to give relief on the social tax rate to entrepreneurs who have established non-state kindergartens with a capacity of at least 150 places. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/hamma-gapirayotgan-universitet-nordik-ichkaridan-qanday-korinadi" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Source: Prepared based on the information of the oliygoh.uz website.
