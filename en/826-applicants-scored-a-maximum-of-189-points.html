But this year's performance was <strong>undoubtedly a record</strong>. Even in the earlier so-called "bunker periods", so many applicants did not score the maximum score. This, of course, is a sign of our youth's passion for science.</p> <h3>What was the reason for the maximum score?</h3> <p>Today, international and national certificates also contribute a lot to the maximum score. But do not forget that the certificate is not just an official document, it is a symbol of knowledge. That is, the applicant received this certificate based on his knowledge.</p> <h2>The number of people who scored the maximum points in the science section</h2> <h3>Biology + chemistry complex (259 people)</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Uzbek language: 227 people</p> </li> <li> <p>Russian language: 18 people</p> </li> <li> <p>Korakalpak language: 14 people</p> </li> </ul> <h3>English language + mother tongue and literature (234 people)</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Uzbek language: 227 people</p> </li> <li> <p>Russian language: 4 people</p> </li> <li> <p>Korakalpak language: 3 persons</p> </li> </ul> <h3>History + foreign language (146 persons)</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Uzbek language: 145 persons</p> </li> <li> <p>Russian language: 1 person</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Mathematics + foreign language (139 persons)</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Uzbek language: 133 people</p> </li> <li> <p>Russian language: 4 people</p> </li> <li> <p>Korakalpak language: 2 people</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Basics of state and law + foreign language (26 people)</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Uzbek language: 22 people</p> </li> <li> <p>Russian language: 3 people</p> </li> <li> <p>Korakalpak language: 1 person</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Native language and literature + foreign language (16 people)</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Uzbek language: 9 people</p> </li> <li> <p>Russian language: 4 people</p> </li> <li> <p>Korakalpak language: 3 people</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Mathematics + physics (5 people)</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Uzbek language: 5 people</p> </li> </ul> <h3>Physics + mathematics (1 person)</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Uzbek language: 1 person</p> </li> </ul> <p>📌 <em>Note: Temurbek school graduates are not included in the list, a separate quota is allocated for them.</em></p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>2025 test results testify to the thirst for knowledge and diligence of our youth. Individual training, certificates, and the help of teachers played a big role in these achievements. We hope that such positive statistics will be updated every year and the number of educated generations will expand. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/abituriyentlar-va-talabalar-uchun-4-milliard-somlik-millat-umidi-granti-eʼlon-qilindi" rel="dofollow">More information</a></p> <br/><br/>How did this news affect you?
