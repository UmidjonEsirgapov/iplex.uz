                About the expected changes in the education system:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>What volunteers should do: All posters should include the World Wildlife Day logo, the 2022 theme (“Protecting keystone species to restore ecosystems”) and the hashtag #WWD2022.</strong><br/><strong>World Wildlife Day in all six languages logos are available in vector format on the official World Wildlife Day website.</strong><br/><strong>Required Languages: English-Fluent knowledge is required; French: Fluent knowledge preferred; Spanish: Fluent knowledge preferred; Check out the official website for more information.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>General Information:</strong></p> <p><strong>Designing World Wildlife 2022 posters, social media banners and virtual backgrounds</strong></p> <p><strong>CITES</strong> - (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) is an international agreement between governments and its Its purpose is to ensure that the international trade of specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival.</p> <p><strong>In December 2013, <strong>United Nations General Assembly</strong> declared March 3 as World Wildlife Day. The CITES Secretariat has been designated as the facilitator for the global celebration of this day. World Wildlife Day has now become the most important global annual event dedicated to wildlife.</strong></p> <p><strong>What volunteers can do to help:</strong></p> <p>All posters must include the World Wildlife Day logo, the 2022 theme ("Protecting Keystone Species to Restore Ecosystems") and the hashtag #WWD2022. Each design should include enough space to contain the subject text. Then, a separate space should be created for each of the six official languages ​​of the UN Volunteer (English, French, Spanish, Russian, Mandarin Chinese and Arabic). The text of the theme in several languages ​​is available to selected designers. World Wildlife Day logos in all six languages ​​are available in vector format on the official World Wildlife Day website. We aim to have almost final designs by mid-January. The designs may take inspiration from previous posters used to celebrate World Wildlife Day. Their motifs should be included in individual products that match the banners of major social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn). The selected designs will be promoted on the social media platforms of the CITES Secretariat, on the official accounts of World Wildlife Day and on the accounts of partner organizations. Volunteers are welcome and contacted in every direction. All posters and banners will also be made available to the public on the information section of the official World Wildlife Day website. Volunteers are currently being recruited for the above tasks.</p> <p><strong>Requirements for youth volunteers:</strong></p> <p><strong>Experience required:</strong></p> <p>Volunteers must have a keen eye for design and knowledge of using multimedia editing and graphic design software. They must be well organized and good at communicating and completing tasks remotely. The working language of the assignment will be English, but knowledge of an additional UN language is desirable. Interest and knowledge of wildlife conservation, trade and sustainable use of biodiversity-based resources preferred.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This project takes place in Switzerland and volunteers are requested to contribute online. The duration of this project is 9 weeks. Volunteers must be able to provide 6-10 hours of assistance per week.</p> <p><strong>Languages required:</strong></p> <ul> <li>English-Fluent knowledge is required;</li> <li>French: Fluency is preferred;</li> <li>Spanish: Fluency is preferred;</li> </ul> <p><strong>Get acquainted with the detailed information on the official site.</strong> — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/epam-sap-development-boyicha-bepul-kursga-arizalar-qabul-qilmoqda" rel="dofollow">Source</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources..
