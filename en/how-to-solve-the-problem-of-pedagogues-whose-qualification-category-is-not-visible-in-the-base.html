                Useful information for applicants and students:<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong><br/><strong>High-class teachers with 25 years of work experience fell into the intermediate category.</strong><br/><strong>How to solve the problem of these teachers?</strong><br/><strong>The qualification category did not appear in the "base" or the pedagogues who fell into the intermediate category for some reasons were organized in the regions they should contact the working groups.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><strong>Attention of pedagogues whose qualification category is not visible in the "base"</strong></p> <p><strong>Question</strong>: The qualification category of some teachers is not visible in "<strong>UZASBO</strong>", and <strong>"ERP base"</strong> is also not visible. High-class teachers with 25 years of work experience fell into the <strong>intermediate category</strong>. How to solve the problem of these teachers?</p> <p><strong>Answer</strong>: Such situations are observed in several regions of our republic. Xalqta'liminfo.uz addressed <strong>Sardor Rahimboyev</strong>, head of the Pedagogical Personnel Department of the Ministry of Preschool and School Education.</p> <p>Currently, the main problems are arising in the process of integrating qualification categories into the system. Rahimboyev said that all platforms have been integrated into the "UZASBO-2" program, but some problems with loading old certificates into the system continue. Who should pedagogues turn to? should apply to the established working groups.</p> <p></p> <h3><strong>The issue of high-class teachers with 45 years of work experience</strong></h3> <p>In some regions, there are complaints that the qualification category of high-class teachers with 45 years of work experience is not preserved for life. According to Rahimboyev, relevant groups are working on this problem and teachers will be <strong>paid the difference</strong>. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/malaka-test-sinovlari-otkaziladigan-joy-manzillari" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p> <br/><br/>Follow other news in the field of education.
