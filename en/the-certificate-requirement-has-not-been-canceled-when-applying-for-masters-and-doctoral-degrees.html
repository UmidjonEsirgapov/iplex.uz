                Important news related to higher education institutions:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>Language certificate requirement for admission to master's and doctoral studies has not been canceled Misinterpretations in social networks have been clarified Amendments to some regulatory legal documents based on Presidential Decree No. PF-114, adopted on July 19, 2025 </strong><br/><strong>In particular, the fourth paragraph of Clause 6 of Resolution No. PQ-5117 dated May 19, 2021 was deleted.</strong><br/><strong>For the first time, the requirement of a foreign language certificate was provided for in this clause. <h3>Misinterpretations in social networks have been clarified</h3> <p>On the basis of <strong>Presidential Decree No. PF-114</strong> adopted on July 19, 2025, some regulatory legal documents have been amended. In particular, the fourth paragraph of Clause 6 of Resolution No. PQ-5117 of May 19, 2021 was deleted. The requirement of a foreign language certificate was provided for the first time in this paragraph.</p> <p>On this basis, a false conclusion appeared in social networks that this requirement has now been <strong>completely cancelled</strong>. However, this is <strong>contrary to the truth</strong>.</p> <h3>Decree No. PF-81: Requirements are clearly defined</h3> <p>According to <strong>Presidential Decree No. PF-81</strong> published on May 24, 2024, the requirement for a <strong>foreign language certificate</strong> for admission to graduate and post-graduate education is defined as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>For foreign languages</strong> - at least <strong>C1</strong> level;</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Social, economic, humanitarian and technical fields</strong> - at least <strong>B2</strong> level;</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Other educational areas</strong> and <strong>culture and in sports specialties - at least at the <strong>B1</strong> level.</strong></p> </li> </ul> <h3>Current requirements are still valid</h3> <p>The Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation stated that the requirement for a foreign language certificate based on Decree No. PF-81 is <strong>still valid</strong>. With Decree No. PF-114, only the previous legal bases were changed, but the requirement itself was <strong>not canceled</strong>.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>National or international certificates confirming the level of knowledge of a foreign language are <strong>still mandatory</strong> for admission to master's and doctoral studies. Making a decision based on false interpretations circulating on social media <strong>can lead to problems in the admissions process</strong>. It is recommended to follow the official sources and carefully study the requirements for submitting documents. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/maktab-baholarini-imtihonlarda-hisobga-olish-bekor-boladimi" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is obtained from official sources.</strong>
