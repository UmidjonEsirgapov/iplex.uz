So don't wait for big achievements to congratulate yourself, says BJ Fogg, director of Stanford's Incentive Technologies Lab. Instead, create daily holidays for yourself; your brain doesn't distinguish between real success and what it looks like.</p> <h3>Be physically active</h3> <p>According to neurologist Etena van der Walt, physical activity is one of the best ways to improve brain health. When we exercise, our heart rate increases, oxygen reaches the brain faster, and new brain cells develop faster. The faster brain cells are produced, the easier it is for them to develop new neural pathways and interact with each other. Eventually, our brains become more efficient and flexible. This means mental activity. If you decide to be active, do more.</p> <h3>Exercise your brain</h3> <p>If you don't use your brain, it will lose its efficiency like other organs of the body. Learning a new language, playing a new musical instrument, or even juggling are good exercises.</p> <h3>Sit up</h3> <p>Mothers around the world encourage their children to sit up straight. Not only does upright posture improve energy levels and overall mood, but it also boosts confidence. In 2013, the results of a study conducted by Harvard professor Amy Cuddy and her colleague Maarten Bos confirmed this. A weak, slouched body position makes the brain more prone to insecurity, depressive memories and thoughts. Although more research needs to be done, there seems to be a connection between the amount of light emitted from electronic screens and sleep. According to Swart, a senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the brain's natural cleansing system requires six to eight hours. Without it, the brain eventually encounters large deposits of beta-amyloid. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/qaysi-sertifikat-necha-foiz-ustama-beradi-toliq-royxat" rel="dofollow">Official Data</a></p> <br/><br/>This information is taken from official sources.
