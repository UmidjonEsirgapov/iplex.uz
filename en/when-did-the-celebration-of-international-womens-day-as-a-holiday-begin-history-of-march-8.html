                The latest news in the field of education is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Brief content:</strong><br/><strong>For the first time, International Women's Day was celebrated on March 8, 1911.</strong><br/><strong>In 1957, the inscription "March 8 - International Women's Day of Struggle for Social Rights of Women" appeared at the UN.</strong><br/><strong>In 2021, this holiday It was celebrated for the 111th time.</strong><br/><hr/> <p><em>The roots of International Women's Day go back to the centuries-old struggle for the right of women to participate in public life on an equal basis with men. International Women's Day is a global day dedicated to the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. Also, on this day, actions are encouraged to accelerate gender equality. International Women's Day is widely celebrated all over the world on March 8.</em></p> <p>International Women's Day, which is celebrated every year on March 8, is one of the most important days of the year. This day represents the following goals:</p> <ul> <li>celebrating the achievements and achievements of women;</li> <li>raising awareness about the equal rights of women;</li> <li>widely campaigning and accelerating gender equality issues;</li> <li>raising funds for women's charities.</li> </ul> <p>Gloria is an internationally known feminist, journalist and social activist. Steinem once explained this day as follows: "The history of women's struggle for equality does not belong to any feminist propaganda or to any country or organization, but to the collective efforts of all people engaged in human rights."</p> <p></p> <p>This day also has its own colors. There are three main colors representing International Women's Day: purple, green and white. Purple symbolizes justice and dignity. Green means hope. White color, although it is a controversial concept, symbolizes purity. The colors were adopted by the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in Great Britain in 1908.</p> <h3><strong>Empty Pots March</strong></h3> <p><img class="size-full wp-image-1677782" src="https://daryo.uz/cache/2021/03/unnamed-2-512x321.jpg"/></p> <p>On March 8, 1857, at the call of the Women's Social Democratic Organization, female workers of a textile factory in New York walked the streets of Manhattan with empty dishes and pans, demanding that women's work be given low wages, poor working conditions and equal rights with men. At that time, women worked up to 16 hours a day and were paid very little for their work. Before that, men also rebelled against the 16-hour work several times, as a result of which they achieved the establishment of an organization protecting the right to work and a 10-hour working day. Later, in many factories in the United States, unions emerged and men were admitted to membership. The women beat the spoons on the empty pans, expressed their displeasure, chanted various slogans and chants. About 15 thousand women participated in this march. This event attracted the attention of not only the American public, but the whole world. The day after the march, an article appeared in the Herald Tribune (now The New York Times) under the headline "Empty Pot March" and it became a worldwide sensation. For the first time after March 8, 1857, women joined trade unions. In addition, on this day, hundreds of women demonstrated in many cities of New York demanding the right to vote.</p> <p>On August 27, 1910, a delegation of women from New York participated in the All-European Women's Forum in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. The delegation included the famous German revolutionary Clara Setkin. In a fiery speech at the forum, she said: "The women of New York were right, and the women of Europe should make the same demands. I propose that March 8 be called the day of struggle for women's social rights."</p> <p><img class="border ls-is-cached lazyloaded" data-action="zoom" data-src="/cache/2021/03/1-z158-b1912_fr_hd_72dpi-341x487.jpg" src="https://daryo.uz/cache/2021/03/1-z158-b1912_fr_hd_72dpi-341x487.jpg"/></p> <p>This speech is the basis for the March 8 holiday </p> <p>The first International Women's Day was celebrated on March 8, 1911. Gradually, the number of countries celebrating this date in one way or another increased. In 1957, the inscription "March 8 - the International Day of Struggle for Women's Social Rights" appeared at the UN.</p> <p>The first women's demonstration in Russia on March 8, 1913 was held in solidarity with European women. In 1965, the USSR decided to make March 8 a holiday.</p> <h3><strong>The place of the holiday in the life of women</strong></h3> <p>International Women's Day is a holiday for all women who have made a worthy contribution to the creation of history. It's no secret that throughout history, women have done a lot of good behind the scenes. But at the beginning of the 20th century, the role of women in public life began to emerge more clearly. In January 1906, the first Russian higher technical educational institution for women was opened in St. Petersburg. In January 1909, the world's first women's auto race began in New York. In April 1989, the first performance of the women's "Vivaldi Orchestra" took place.</p> <p></p> <p>International Women's Day is recognized as an official holiday in Russia, North Korea, China and many other countries. Although March 8 is not considered a holiday in several countries of the world, it is becoming more and more popular every year with a bias in the feminist spirit. Today, the main promoter of this date is the United Nations. In 1977, the United Nations selected participating countries to celebrate the ideals of women's equality and world peace on March 8.</p> <p>Countries that support the UN primarily use this holiday as an excuse to raise important social issues for women. Year after year, the UN chooses priority topics that protect the interests of women. In 2013, on this day, the topic of opposing violence against women was discussed, and in 2014, the topic of equality for women - development for all was put on the agenda. — <a href="https://infoedu.uz/barcha-maktab-darsliklarining-pdf-elektron-variantini-yuklab-oling" rel="dofollow">Details here</a></p>
